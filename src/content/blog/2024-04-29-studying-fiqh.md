Muwaffaq al-Din b. Qudamah (620 AH) wrote in the introduction to **al-Mughni**:

> Allah appointed amongst the predecessors of this Ummah, imams from the luminaries. He paved through them the principles of Islam, and He clarified through them difficult rulings. Their agreement is clear-cut proof, and their disagreement is a vast mercy. Hearts are revived by hearing about their lives and happiness is attained by following in their footsteps.
>
> Thereafter, He specified a handful from amongst them according to their position and rank, in knowledge and piety, and preserved their mention and their schools of thought. Rulings revolve around their statements and the jurists of Islam refer to their schools to issue verdicts.
>
> Our Imam, Abu Abdallah Ahmad b. Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, is from the highest of them in virtue, the closest in his connection to Allah, the most emulous of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and most knowledgeable of his Sunnah, the most minimal in indulging in the Dunya, and the most dedicated to voluntary worship of his Lord. For this reason, we have chosen his school.

The following curriculum is based on the assumption that one has studied the basics through works such as **Bidayat al-῾Abid**, **Kafi al-Mubtadi**, **῾Umdat al-Talib**, **Akhsar al-Mukhtasarat**, or **Al-Aqwal Al-Mardiyyah**; the last of which mentions hadith for each issue and avoids the cryptic language found in other primers.

<b>Dalil al-Talib li-Nayl al-Marib</b> by Mar῾i b. Yusuf al-Karmi (1033 AH)
</center>

This book is widely taught throughout the Arabian Peninsula and was often memorized in Sham. It is very clear and contains more detail than other books of a similar size. Listen to the recordings of **Muhammad ῾Abd al-Wahid**, which are indispensable for clarifying the positions of the madhab.

A beneficial commentary to begin with is **Irshad al-Sahib** by ῾Abd al-Karim al-Namlah. This work breaks the text into individual masa’il and clearly outlines the process of istidlal by explaining the sources of rulings and their connections to other principles. Afterwards, one must read **Fath Wahhab al-Marib** by Ibn ῾Iwad (1140 AH), which encompasses all other commentaries written on Dalil al-Talib. Ibn ῾Iwad brings important details from longer books, along with fine points that cannot be found elsewhere. 

For revision, use **al-As῾ilat wa’l-Ajwibat** by ῾Abd al-Wahid al-Faris, which presents the masa῾il of ibadah and mu῾amalat in a question-and-answer format.

<center>
 <u>Ikhtilaf:</u> <b>Raf’ al-Malam</b> by Taqi al-Din b. Taymiyyah (728 AH)
</center>

Ibn Taymiyyah’s **Raf' al-Malam** provides a solid foundation for the asbab of khilaf. It must be accompanied with the audio commentary of **Yusuf al-Ghafis**, which provides invaluable advice on dealing with khilaf and how to approach one’s studies.

<center>
 <u>Usul al-Fiqh:</u> <b>Mukhtasar al-Tahrir</b> by Ibn al-Najjar al-Futuhi
</center>

The book to study at this level is **Mukhtasar al-Tahrir** by Ibn al-Najjar. He authored this text as an abridgement of **Tahrir al-Manqul** by al-Mardawi, with similar coverage to **Jam al-Jawami’** by Taj al-Din al-Subki. At this stage, focus intensely on the ‘aqli foundations of the principles throughout the text. Listen to the lessons of **Hasan Bukhari** on the book.

<center>
 <u>Adillah:</u> <b>‘Umdat al-Ahkam</b> by ‘Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi
</center>

After studying a text on fiqh and usul, one should incorporate regular readings of hadith of legal rulings collections into their schedule. At this stage, one will become more familiar with previously unfamiliar vocabulary in hadith while also beginning to identify the evidence for the rulings studied earlier by practically applying usul al-fiqh.

**‘Umdat al-Ahkam** by ‘Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi contains just under 500 narrations, all of them mutafaqqun ‘alayh. It is essential to read its commentary **Al-Ihkam** by Ibn Daqiq al-’Id, where he deduces the rulings from each hadith in a masterful way. This book is one of the greatest works ever written on applied usul al-fiqh and cannot be done without.

<center>
 <u>‘Aqidah:</u> <b>Qala’id al-Iqyan</b> by Ibn Balban al-Ba’li
</center>

Al-Saffarini mentions that this book was read and relied upon for centuries among Hanbalis. It is an abridgement of Ibn Hamdan’s **Nihayat al-Mubtadi’in**, and as such it serves as a short primer on the subject. Ibn Hamdan was familiar with the terminology of the mutakallimin, and was able to categorize the positions of the madhab into their framework. It must be read with ‘Abdullah al-’Abdullah’s commentary titled **Minhat al-Rahman**, which gathers important details scattered through longer books. It has been versified as a poem by Ahmad al-Jabali.

Complement this with **Lum’at al-I’tiqad** by Ibn Qudamah, a brief textually-oriented primer outlining the beliefs of the Hanbalis. It must be studied with Faris al-Khazraji’s commentary titled **Sabil al-Sadid**.

Memorize **Al-Durrah Al-Mudiyyah** by al-Saffarini, a poem outlining various aqa’id. The best edition of the book is that of ‘Abdullah al-’Abdullah, which also includes his detailed footnotes titled **al-Taqrirat al-Hanbaliyyah**.

## <center>Intermediate Level (الإقتصاد)</center>

<br>
<center>
<b>Al-Rawd Al-Murbi'</b> by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti (1052 AH)
</center>

This book is a brilliant commentary on **Zad al-Mustaqni῾** by Musa al-Hajjawi (968 AH). Zad al-Mustaqni was itself abridged from **al-Muqni'** by Ibn Qudamah (620 AH), which was written to introduce differences of opinion within the madhab. Al-Hajjawi restricted it to what he considered the relied-upon opinions of the madhhab. In contrast to Dalil al-Talib, which was widely studied in Sham, Zad al-Mustaqni' became the main text studied among Hanbalis in the Gulf. 

Due to the status of the original author, the abridger, and the commentator, **al-Rawd al-Murbi** has become an extremely important work within madhhab, relied upon for both teaching and delivering legal rulings. Listen to the lessons of **Muhammad ῾Abd al-Wahid** and **Yusuf al-Ghafis** on the chapters they cover and also read **Jam῾ al-Rahiq al-Mushbi῾** also by Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid, which beautifully elaborates on the text. 

For major ishkalat, begin referencing the equivalent passage in the commentaries of **al-Muqni῾** including as **al-Mumti῾**, **al-Mubdi῾**, **al-Shafi**, and **al-Insaf**. Doing this will build one’s expertise in fiqh and will provide the foundation for a complete study of **al-Muqni῾** at a later stage. 

Supplement this with **Hidayat al-Raghib** by Ibn Qa’id al-Najdi (1094 AH), his commentary on **‘Umdat al-Talib** by al-Buhuti. Ibn Qa῾id mentions qawa῾id, conditions, exceptions, and reasoning of the masa῾il, which are among the most important things to learn for an intermediate student. This book matches al-Rawd al-Murbi’ to a large extent, on top of being organized and well-presented. Ibn ῾Iwad has an important hashiyah on Hidayat al-Raghib titled **Fath Muli al-Mawahib**.

Read **Muqaddimat al-Insaf** by al-Mardawi (885 AH). This will explain the structure of the madhab and the approach used by the muta’akhirin to determine the madhab’s relied-upon positions.

<center>
 <u>Usul al-Fiqh:</u> <b>Sharh Mukhtasar al-Rawdah</b> by Najm al-Din al-Tufi
</center>

This book is beloved by the Hanbalis who deem it the best work on usul al-fiqh ever written. It is the author’s commentary on his abridgement of **Rawdat al-Nadhir**, Ibn Qudamah’s recension of **al-Mustasfa** by al-Ghazali. Al-Tufi had a unique, accessible style, and his book is filled with gems of humility.

Before reading each section in **Sharh Mukhtasar al-Rawdah**, read the corresponding passage in al-Mustasfa. Listen to the recorded lessons of Hasan Bukhari on **Mukhtasar al-Rawdah** and for revision, use **Taysir Fahm Rawdat al-Nadhir** by Majid al-’Askari, which presents the material in question-answer format.

Complement this by reading **Tashnif al-Masami’** by al-Zarkashi, his commentary on Taj al-Din al-Subki’s **Jam al-Jawami’**. This is an excellent follow-up to **Sharh Mukhtasar al-Rawdah**. The author had a gift in knowing how to sift through opinions and engage with the tradition. Listen to the recordings of Hasan Bukhari on **Jam’ al-Jawami’** while studying this book.

<center>
 <u>Adillah:</u> <b>Al-Muharrar</b> by Shams al-Din b. ‘Abd al-Hadi
</center>

Although this book is primarily on **ahadith al-ahkam**, it should also be studied for **‘ilal**, **tashih**, and **tadh’if**. Ibn ‘Abd al-Hadi took **al-Ilmam** by Ibn Daqiq al-‘Id and summarized it with a focus on judging the hadith and mentioning **‘ilal**. Listen to the recorded lessons of ‘Abdulaziz al-Tarifi.

</center>

Read **Al-’Ayn wa’l-Athar** by Al-Ba’li with its commentary: **Ittiba’ al-Athar** by Faris al-Khazraji.

The most important work on internal Hanbali khilaf is **Nihayat al-Mubtadi’in** by Ibn Hamdan. Use the edition of Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid, which provides the reference for each position mentioned, and listen to the recorded commentary of ‘Abdurrahman al-Salti.

Supplement this by reading **Mukhtasar Lawami’ al-Anwar** by Hasan al-Shatti, his summary of al-Saffarini’s much longer commentary.

At some point, read **Hallal al-’Uqad** by Najm al-Din al-Tufi, a detailed commentary on Hadith Jibril. In this work, he presents the views of other groups and assesses their evidence from an impartial perspective.

</center>

<br>

<center>
 <u>Adab:</u> <b>Sharh Mandhumah al-Adab</b> by Musa b. Ahmad al-Hajjawi
</center>

Read **Sharh Mandhumah al-Adab** by Musa al-Hajjawi, his commentary on Ibn ‘Abd al-Qawi’s poem. Al-Hajjawi ends the book with comprehensive advice about having taqwa, devoting oneself to performing acts of obedience, having sincerity in all situations, and cleansing the heart.

## <center>Advanced Level (الاستقصاء)</center>

<br>
<center>
<b>Daqa῾iq Uli al-Nuha</b> by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti (1052 AH)
</center>

This book is also well-known as **Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat**. It is Mansur al-Buhuti’s commentary on **Muntaha al-Iradat** by Ibn al-Najjar, where he combined **al-Muqni῾** with **al-Tanqih** by al-Mardawi to produce a summary of the madhab’s relied-upon positions. 

While studying this, reference **Kashaf al-Qina῾** by al-Buhuti, his commentary on **al-Iqna῾** by al-Hajjawi. Along with Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat, these two books are the usual reference points for finding the madhab’s relied-upon opinions. When they disagree, Sharh al-Muntaha is typically given precedence since it was written later, and if one of the two is unclear on an issue, the other is used to explain it. 

Another useful reference is **Sharh al-῾Umdah** by Ibn Taymiyyah (728 AH). Although incomplete, it remains one of the most comprehensive works on adillah of the madhab. He made it a point to mention all of the different opinions within the madhab, along with explaining whether a position is from the riwayat, wujuh, or aqwal from the students of Ahmad. 

Supplement this with **al-Kafi** by Faris al-Khazraji, his revision of Ibn Qudamah’s original in line with the madhab’s relied-upon opinions. This book focuses on presenting the ta’tilat of the madhab, in contrast to al-Muqni῾, where various positions are presented without explanation.

Begin reading through **Zad al-Musafir** by Ghulam al-Khallal (363 AH), his abridgement of **al-Jami῾** by Abu Bakr al-Khallal (311 AH). Al-Khallal can be considered the founder of the madhab due to his efforts in collecting Ahmad’s opinions from his students and performing tarjih between them. Reading this will introduce one to the direct statements of the imam, and how the madhab’s opinions developed from them. 

For an overview of the madhab’s mufradat and an introduction to fiqh al-khilaf, read **al-Minah al-Shafiyyat** by al-Buhuti, his commentary on Ibn ῾Abd al-Qawi’s (699 AH) poem. 

<center>
 <u>Usul al-Fiqh:</u> <b>Al-Tahbir</b> by ‘Ala al-Din al-Mardawi
</center>

Supplement this with **Al-Bahr Al-Muhit** by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi. Similar to Al-Tahbir, this book is an encyclopedia and the last truly great work written on usul al-fiqh. Nothing after comes close to its scope and depth. Also read al-Zarkashi’s **Salasil al-Dhahab**, which presents many issues and contentions not found in the books of usul al-fiqh.

Read **Dar al-Qawl al-Qabih** by al-Tufi and **Al-Masa’il Al-Mushtarikah** by Muhammad al-’Arusi, which are both important for understanding the relationship between ‘aqidah and many issues in usul al-fiqh.

Knowing which qara’in to take into consideration for sarf of amr and nahy to wujub and tahrim is one of the most important topics in this science, but is never addressed in books of usul al-fiqh. Neither the books of fiqh nor commentaries on hadith will explain this qarinah either. Instead, read **Dawabit Sarf al-Amr wa’l-Nahy** by Khalid al-Otaibi.

Finally, read **‘Iqd al-Mandhum** by al-Qarafi, which deals with all the asbab of ‘umum.

<center>
 <u>Adillah:</u> <b>Fath al-Bari</b> by Zayn al-Din b. Rajab
</center>

In this book, Ibn Rajab masterfully links hadith, athar of the salaf, madhahib of fuqaha, and the riwayat of Ahmad. However, he was not able to complete it. Ibn Hajar later wrote his well-known commentary on Sahih Bukhari out of inspiration from Ibn Rajab’s original.

<center>
 <u>Al-Qawa’id Al-Fiqhiyyah:</u> <b>Taqrir al-Qawa’id</b> by Zayn al-Din b. Rajab
</center>

Listen to the recorded commentary on Qawa’id Ibn Rajab by Khalid al-Mushayqih.

<center>
 <u>Al-Qawa’id Al-Usuliyyah:</u> <b>Al-Qawa’id</b> by ‘Ala al-Din b. al-Lahham
</center>

Supplement this with **Takhrij al-Furu’ ‘ala al-Usul** by Uthman Shushan. Shushan relies on many different sources and brings examples from Ibn Qudamah’s al-Mughni, making it one of the most comprehensive works on the subject. A contemporary masterpiece in this area is Mustafa al-Khinn’s exemplary doctoral thesis, **Athar al-Ikhtilaf fi al-Qawa’id al-Usuliyyah**, where he demonstrates how usuli principles result in different furu’ among jurists.

Read **Al-Idah** by Ibn al-Zaghuni, which is one of the most detailed books on Hanbali aqa’id ever written. The book is structured as a debate with an interlocutor as Ibn al-Zaghuni covers each topic, from the divine attributes to the imamate.

Read **Al-Kawkab Al-Duriyyah** by Al-Karmi.


## <center>Mastery (الإتقان)</center>

<br>
<center>
<b>Al-Muqni῾</b> by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (620 AH)
</center>

The first step of this level is a study of al-Muqni῾ and the family of works based on it. One should aim for mastery, which entails being able to independently arrive at the same conclusions the imams of the madhab have reached. Read the following commentaries simultaneously: 

- **Al-Mutli῾** by Shams al-Din b. Abi al-Fath (709 AH)
- **Al-Mumti῾** by Abu’l-Barkat b. al-Munajja (695 AH)
- **Al-Shafi** by Shams al-Din b. Abi ῾Umar (682 AH)
- **Al-Mubdi῾** by Burhan al-Din b. Muflih (884 AH)
- **Al-Insaf** by ῾Ala al-Din al-Mardawi (885 AH)

**Al-Shafi**, also known as **al-Sharh al-Kabir**, was written by the author as a rearrangement of his uncle Ibn Qudamah’s **al-Mughni** based on the organization of **al-Muqni῾**. The original work by Ibn Qudamah is considered one of the most comprehensive books in fiqh ever written, allowing one to observe every aspect of using, debating, defending, and deconstructing aqyisah. 

**Al-Insaf** is the encyclopedia of internal Hanbali differences, with the relied-upon view being highlighted. Imam al-Mardawi marks the final stage of development for the madhab and was given the laqab of al-Murajjih, al-Musahhih, and al-Munaqqih.

Of these commentaries, al-Mumti῾ largely focuses on istidlal and niqash, al-Insaf on naql of the madhab, al-Sharh al-Kabir on adillah, while al-Mubdi῾ strikes a balance between istidlal and naql. The last two were heavily influential on later scholars for istidlal of the madhab. Considered together, these commentaries strike a balance between studying khilaf ῾ali, which widens ones perspective, and khilaf nazil, which deepens one’s understanding of each far’ and the subtitles of ta῾lil. It is impossible to delve, with some semblance of objectivity, into works of istidlalat and khilaf ῾ali and come out still holding to all of the madhab’s relied-upon positions. However, doing this will increase one’s respect for the genius of the madhab's imam and overall approach.

After this, the objective is to understand the development of the madhab’s opinions. Using Ibn Muflih’s **al-Furu’** as the foundation, reference the nusus of Ahmad gathered by the madhab’s earliest scholars. Begin by reading **Masa’il Abu Dawud** and **Masa’il ‘Abdullah** as they are the most organized and reliable collections. Then read **Masa’il al-Kawsaj**, which includes the opinions of both Ahmad and Ibn Rahawayh. Al-Kawsaj’s collection was an important source for ahl al-hadith, and al-Kawsaj was al-Tirmidhi main source for the opinions of Ahmad. At times, the madhab uses the statements of Ibn Rahawayh to perform tarjih between the opinions of Ahmad, such as for the obligation of tasmiyyah in wudu’ and placement of the hands in salah. 

Repeat this process for the other madhabs and their ummahat. Begin with the Shafi’i madhab due to the natural connection between it and the Hanbali madhab. Imam Ahmad mentions that al-Shafi’i gave Ahl al-Hadith a framework to clearly extract rulings from the nusus and often recommended studying his works. Read **Nihayat al-Matlab** by Abu'l-Ma'ali al-Juwayni and **al-Umm** by al-Shafi’i. Nihayat al-Matlab is one of the greatest works in fiqh ever written, where al-Juwayni clearly explains the ta’lilat and shows how the furu’ of a bab tie back to the ta’lil of its usul. Al-Shafi'i himself will similarly begin each chapter with his evidence and branch out from there. His reasoning is of higher quality and much more transparent than what many later texts and commentaries within the Shafi’i madhab provide. Read Abu Shamah’s **Khutbah al-Kitab al-Mu’ammal**. **Al-Awsat** by Ibn al-Mundhir should also be consulted, as he was an independent jurist with a Shafi’i pedigree. 

Read **Bada’i al-Sana’i** by 'Ala al-Din al-Kasani and **al-Asl** by Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-Shaybani. 

Before commencing with the Maliki madhab, read **Tasmiya wa’l-Hikayat** by al-Saraqusti. This early book on tabaqat sheds light on how a madhab is built and evolves, politics and issues between scholars, along with how, and why, certain books become relied upon in the madhab. Read **al-Dhakhirah** by al-Qarafi and **al-Mudawwanah** by Shanun. 

For contemporary issues in finance, read **al-Mu’amalat al-Maliyyah** by al-Dubayyan.
