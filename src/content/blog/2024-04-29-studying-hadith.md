<center><b>Al-Wadih</b>
by ‘Abdulaziz al-Shaya’</center>

Al-Wadih by ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Shaya’ is the best introductory work for the mustalah. Written by a professor of hadith at Jami’at al-Imam in Riyadh, the book is clear, comprehensive, and organized with tables and charts which attest to the author’s experience as a teacher as well as an author. It gives the student a solid foundation for further study. 

<center><b>Al-Arba’in</b>
by Yahya b. Sharaf al-Nawawi</center>

This must be read with Ibn Rajab’s commentary, Jami al-’Ulum wa’l-Hikam. He has a clear style and often brings different variations of a narration or the statements of earlier scholars to establish the meaning of a hadith. This can be supplemented with al-Ta’yin by Al-Tufi, who extracts important principles from the text. Sh. Hatim al-’Awni says that if someone reads these two books, he will emerge with fawa’id not found elsewhere.

<center><b>Al-Muqizah</b>
by Shams al-Din al-Dhahabi</center>

The book to study at this level is al-Muqizah by al-Dhahabi, his abridgement of al-Iqtirah by Ibn Daqiq al-’Id. It must be accompanied with the transcribed commentaries of Hatim al-’Awni and ‘Abdullah al-Sa’d. This will form the foundation for one’s later studies in mustalah. 

<center><b>Al-Muwatta</b>
by Malik b. Anas al-Madani</center>

Study of the major hadith books should begin with those written during the age of codification and compilation, chief of which is Malik’s Muwatta. It is the briefest in length, shortest in chains, and has an excellent selection of hadith. Become familiar with its chains, such as: 

- Malik – Nafi – Ibn Umar
- Hisham b. Urwa – His father – Aisha
- Zuhri – Abi Salamah b. Abd al-Rahman – Abu Hurayrah
- Abu Zinad – al-A’raj – Abu Hurayrah

Imam Malik used to revise his Muwatta’ year after year, carefully selecting which hadith were included. Due to this, there is variation between the different narrations. Study the narration of al-Qa’nabi as it is the riwayah preferred by the muhaddithin, including Imam Ahmad. 

Hatim al-’Awni recommends reading Al-Qabas by Ibn al-’Arabi. In contrast to Al-Masalik by the same author, Al-Qabas is a brief, thematic commentary on al-Muwatta. Supplement this with Ahmad Nur Sayf’s Amal Ahl al-Madinah, which explains the terminology used by Imam Malik throughout al-Muwatta. Al-Shafi’i’s Ikhtilaf Malik is also an essential read regarding claims of Medinan consensus. 

<center><b>‘Ulum al-Hadith</b>
by Ibn al-Salah al-Shahrazuri</center>

The importance of mastering Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah, cannot be stressed enough, as it was the basis for many subsequent works in the field. Ibn al-Salah’s book was uniquely written. It consists of transcribed lectures he held, for which he took material from the different books al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, along with al-Hakim, Ibn Hibban, al-Ramahurmuzi and others.

The audio recordings of Hatim al-‘Awni on Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah are excellent and must be listened to completely. Tariq Awad Allah edited an edition that includes both Nukat Ibn Hajar and al-‘Iraqi Al-Taqyid wa’l-Idah. One must also consult the Nukat al-Zarkashi. Ahmad Ma’bad Abd al-Karim always advises that one read these in chronological order: al-‘Iraqi, then al-Zarkashi, then Ibn Hajar. While reading through Ibn al-Salah’s Muqaddimah, reference Fath al-Mughith by al-Sakhawi, which is his commentary on Afliyyat al-’Iraqi. This book is very beneficial for understanding the approach of the muta’akhirin.

One must also study Imam Muslim’s Muqaddimah, which is essentially a book on mustalah where Muslim implicitly outlines each of the five conditions. Ibn al-Salah would later extract the five conditions from this work along with the writings of al-Hakim.

At this juncture, two works must be covered which explain the nomenclature and other topics related to ‘ulum al-hadith according to the understanding of the early masters of this science: al-Manhaj al-Muqtarah by Hatim al-‘Awni and Tahrir ‘Ulum al-Hadith by Abdullah al-Juday’.

For an introduction to al-jarh wa’l-ta’dil, start with Khulasat al-Ta’sil by Hatim al-’Awni along with the author’s recorded commentary. Sh. Abdullah al-Sa'd has a number of lectures dealing with this topic, but no particular series.

Studying ‘ilm al-’ilal is the end goal of hadith criticism. Begin with Imam Muslim’s Al-Tamyiz, and the audio commentary of Abdullah al-Sa’d; then read through Al-’Illat wa-Ajnasuha by Mustafa Bahu, which Hatim al-’Awni recommends over other books on the topic.

Building upon Abdullah al-Sa’d’s audio commentary of Muslim’s Tamyiz, Hatim al-‘Awni’s book Al-Madkhal ila-Fahm ‘Ilm al-‘Ilal is a brief, but excellent, step into ‘ilal. Begin with Al-Hadith Al-Munkar by al-Sulaymi, in which he performs lengthy takhrij, analyze the isnad, and then mention the qara’in relevant to this khabar which led an imam to reject the hadith. This book is a good study on shudhudh in practice and understanding what the muhaddithin meant with certain terms. This should be followed by Hamza al-Mallibari’s Al-Hadith Al-Ma’lul, Ali al-Sayyam’s Al-Hadith Al-Mu’all and Al-Manhaj al-‘Ilmi fi-Dirasat al-Hadith al-Mu’all. Tariq b. ‘Awad Allah’s Al-Irshadat must be studied as an excellent and practical book that builds on the previous ‘ilal studies by focusing on mistakes that are frequently made in strengthening hadiths with mutaba’at and shawahid narrations. This will give you a practical understanding of how ‘ilm al-’ilal works.

Read Ida’at Bahthiyyah fi-’Ulum al-Hadith al-Nabawiyyah by Hatim al-’Awni, which includes material from his most important lectures on ‘ulum al-hadith. 

<center><b>Al-Risalah</b>
by Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi’i</center>

Al-Risalah by Imam al-Shafi’i is the earliest treatise on usul al-fiqh and hadith methodology. It was incredibly influential in the development of ‘ulum al-hadith in the sense that later hadith scholars took up al-Shafi’i’s arguments and developed them further. Before studying the text, listen to the recordings of ‘Abdullah al-Daghistani for a thematic overview and read Ahmad El-Shamsy’s The Canonization of Islamic Law, which describes the historical background of al-Shafi’i and the impact of his work. Tariq b. ‘Awad Allah’s al-Naqd al-Banna further clarifies al-Shafi’i’s conditions for accepting marasil reports from tabi’in.

<center><b>Al-Jami’ Al-Musnad Al-Sahih</b>
by Muhammad b. Isma’il al-Bukhari</center>

Both al-Ansari and al-Sakhawi state, perhaps from their teacher Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, that Sahih al-Bukhari takes precedence over other collections due to the extreme care he took in extrapolating rulings, which is the greatest objective in studying hadith, and its superiority over other collections in soundness. It must be accompanied by Ibn Hajar’s classic commentary Fath al-Bari. His introduction, titled Hady al-Sari, contains many fine points of detail and criticism. Ibn Hajar addresses some of al-Daraqutni's objections in Al-Ilzimat, which should also be studied with its audio commentary by Abdullah al-Sa’d. This will further introduce one to ‘ilal al-hadith, which is the most difficult aspect of ‘ulum al-hadith.

Supplement this with Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri’s Fayd al-Bari. Al-Kashmiri consistently shows how the imams differed in istinbat for a particular hadith based on differences in tanqih. The more one learns how to apply it, the more one realizes this bahth is central to all of usul. He also frequently highlights the difference between dalalah of the text and qiyas. Nur al-Din ‘Itr’s book on al-Bukhari’s headings, Al-Imam al-Bukhari wal-Fiqh al-Tarajim, should also be consulted. 

<center><b>Al-Musnad Al-Sahih</b>
by Muslim b. al-Hajjaj</center>

Before commencing with Sahih Muslim, one must read Hatim al-‘Awni’s Ijma’ al-Muhaddithin, which addresses common misconceptions regarding the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim, as well as the mu’an’an controversy discussed in Muslim’s muqaddimah. 

Begin by reading Abu’l-Abbas al-Qurtubi’s Al-Mafhum. In hadith and tafsir, the commentators of Andalus had a habit of expressing their ideas well and concisely, evading much of the mutun-shuruh-hawashi confusion that became common in the east. Follow this up with Imam al-Nawawi’s Minhaj al-Muhaddithin.

Bear in mind Imam Muslim’s methodology. He arranges the hadith in each chapter according to decreasing levels of strength. Thus, the first one or two hadiths are the asl of the chapter topic or argument, of which there are 3,145, and the following hadiths are mutaba’at, from a total of 7,748. Most commentaries miss this point, focusing instead on ahkam al-hadith rather than hadith methodology. Critics have often failed to understand this subtle point and have criticized the mutabi’ hadiths when their main purpose is to support the asl hadiths. A good teacher should be able to point these out and differentiate between them. 

Another key point to note is that Imam Muslim never wrote chapter headings or titles. He simply gathered the hadiths of a particular issue together in order of strength. Later commentators wrote chapter headings, which they deduced from the contents of the hadith. Most editions of Sahih Muslim use Imam al-Nawawi’s chapter headings, due to his great standing in both fiqh and hadith. However, one should check earlier and later commentaries to see how different scholars have understood the chapters. 

<center><b>Al-Sunan</b>
by Abu Dawud al-Sijistani</center>

The Sunan of Abu Dawud should be prepared for by reading Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghuddah’s edition of his Risalat ila Ahl Makkah, which is one of the first treatises on nomenclature and methodology alongside Muslim’s Muqaddimah and al-Shafi’is Risalah. Abdullah al-Sa’d has an excellent audio commentary, focusing on ‘ulum al-hadith, of the opening chapters. The best classical commentary is Mu’alim al-Sunan by al-Khattabi. 

<center><b>Al-Jami’ Al-Kabir</b>
by Abu ‘Isa al-Tirmidhi</center>

The Jami’ of al-Tirmidhi should be introduced through Nur al-Din ‘Itr’s al-Imam al-Tirmidhi wa al-Muwazana Bayna Jami`ihi wa Bayn al-Sahihayn, which was his doctoral thesis at al-Azhar, along with Ibn Rajab’s Sharh ‘Ilal al-Tirmidhi, accompanied by the audio commentary of Hatim al-’Awni. This wonderful book helps to understand al-Tirmidhi’s use of tahsin. 

Abdullah al-Sa’d has an excellent audio commentary of the opening chapters focusing on ‘ulum al-hadith. Read ‘Aridat al-Ahwadhi by Ibn al-‘Arabi and Taklimat Sharh al-Tirmidhi by Zayn al-Din al-’Iraqi. Reference al-Daraqutni’s Al-‘Ilal wherever possible.

When studying the sunan works, analyze each chain of transmission independently and strive to understand the methodology of the early hadith masters. It is crucial to remember that each chain needs to be analyzed individually and in context. Refer to the gradings and justifications of Shu’ayb al-Arna’ut, Abdullah al-Sa’d, and Nasr al-Din al-Albani. When these three agree, it should suffice. When they differ, research it extensively. Reference ‘Ilal al-Daraqutni, ‘Ilal Ibn Abi Hatim, and ‘Ilal Ibn al-Madini. Ibn Abi Hatim only gathers the turuq, in contrast to al-Daraqutni, so his book is much more difficult to read. For this reason, Ibn Abi Hatim’s ‘ilal must be read its excellent ta’liqat by Ibn ‘Abd al-Hadi.

<center><b>Tanqih al-Tahqiq</b>
by Shams al-Din b. ‘Abd al-Hadi</center>

Every work of Ibn ‘Abd al-Hadi has fawa’id, not only ittila’ but also excellent ibarat that illustrate important points of naqd. Read all of Ibn ‘Abd al-Hadi’s rasa’il on hadith. At some point, read Al-Sarim Al-Munki, his refutation of Al-Subki on the issue of visiting graves. Putting the fiqh of the issue aside, this is a masterclass in terms of hadith criticism.
