by Musa'id al-Tayyar</center>

Complement this with Al-Muqaddimat Al-Asassiyah by ‘Abdullah al-Juday’. Listen to Ali Hani’s lecture series titled Al-Tariqat Al-Muthla, a brief introduction on how to approach studying tafsir.

<center><b>Safwat al-Tafsir</b>
by Muhammad Ali al-Sabuni</center>

Safwat al-Tafsir by Ali al-Sabuni focuses on introducing each surah, explaining vocabulary, highlighting subtleties, benefits, placing verses in context in relation to others, presenting the causes of revelation, and rhetorical devices. It is by far the best introductory tafsir ever written. 

It is important at this stage to be consistent. One should plan well and designate a set amount to study each week, sticking to it until one completes the task. A manageable amount is to read half a juz’ a week, or the tafsir of about a page from the Mushaf al-Madinah a day. In this manner, one will have completed the basic tafsir of the Quran in approximately one year.

At this juncture, Ibn Abi Dawud's Al-Masahif is important to read because it contains important information about the early history of the Qur'an, including problematic reports that need further explanation. Listening to Musa’id al-Tayyar’s Tarikh al Qur'an recordings before reading Al-Masahif will give you a framework to analyze and interpret those reports. 

Most ayah endings are obvious but a degree of ambiguity arises in certain places leading to khilaf. These issues are dealt with in ‘ilm ’add al-ayi, for which Sh. Ali Hani highly recommends Al-Muyassar fi-’Ilm ‘Add al-Ayi by Ahmad Shukri. 

For an overview of the meanings of specific words in the Qur’an, read Kulliyat al-Alfadh by al-Qarni. Gharib al-Quran by Ibn Qutaybah is also a highly influential work that is quoted by many of the classical mufassirin such as al-Tabari, al-Qurtubi, and al-Razi. It is relatively brief and the best place to begin looking for the meaning of ambiguous words.

by al-Mahdawi</center>
<br>

The objective at this stage is to familiarize oneself with multiple aspects of tafsir, especially concerning the explanation of words and the various narrations regarding each ayah, without striving to find which is the strongest nor being too concerned when different statements are attributed the same authorities, such as Ibn ‘Abbas. 

One moves beyond having a general picture about each ayah that presents only one meaning and towards applied usul al-tafsir. This includes the causes of different opinions, the categories of interpretation, the rules of interpretation, the rules of giving tarjih, knowing the nomenclature of the mufassirin, various qira’at, causes of revelation, and abrogation.

The ideal intermediate tafsir is **Al-Tahsil** by al-Mahdawi, which organizes tafsir, abrogation, i’rab, ahkam, and qira’at into different sections. 

Zad al-Masir by Ibn al-Jawzi, which concisely presents various opinions without giving tarjih. It was designed as an intermediate tafsir to give basic tools to the student before going in depth. The text is both comprehensive and concise. While studying this book, memorize the various positions of the early mufassirin.

Read Al-Isharat Al-Ilahiyyah by al-Tufi, where he commentates on ayat relevant to aqa’id and usul. This work is frequently quoted in later Hanbali usul books, and is important for learning to recognize ‘umum and khusus in the Qur’an. 

Also read Ahkam al-Qur’an by Abu Bakr b. al-’Arabi. Out of all of those who authored a book on this topic, he had the most malakah in the ulum with his own ijtihadat. 

To get familiar with the usage of majaz in the Qur’an, read Majaz al-Qur’an by Izz al-Din b. ‘Abd al-Salam. Then reference Asas al-Balaghah of al-Zamakhshari, where he brings examples of majaz for each root and explains them as well.

<center><b>Al-Muharrar Al-Wajiz</b>
by Abu Muhammad b. Attiyah</center>

At this stage one begins to address the issue of tarjih and knowing which view is most correct about what is said about each ayah, as well as the strongest non-preponderant views, as these have the possibility of also being correct. 

Ibn Attiyah’s tafsir, Muharrar Al-Wajiz, pays great attention to establishing tarjih from the sayings of the Salaf, and also trains one for tarjih between different opinions. It was highly regarded by Ibn Khaldun and Ibn Taymiyyah due to its extensive and meticulous research, summarizing the formative tradition with the most accurate narrations, and was influential on later mufassirin such as al-Qurtubi, Abu Hayyan, and Ibn Kathir.

When Ibn Atiyyah quotes from earlier scholars, he looks very critically at what they say, making sure that what he quotes is correct and accurate. Ibn Atiyyah explains his methodology: ‘I proceed in this commentary according to the word order of every verse, explaining its rulings, grammatical positions, linguistic functions, meanings and the pronunciation of different methods of recitation.’ His tafsir is excellently arranged and follows a logical progression with an emphasis on language.

<center><b>Jami’ al-Bayan</b>
by Abu Ja’far al-Tabari</center>

The objective of this stage is to study the major references and give tarjih based on the skills acquired in the previous stages. Focus on each tafsir with respect to what the author was distinguished for, whether that be language, fiqh, or qira’at. Using Jami’ al-Bayan by al-Tabari as the foundation, reference the following works:

- Futuh al-Ghuyub by Muhyi al-Din al-Tibi
- Ruh al-Ma’ani by Mahmud b. ‘Abdullah al-Alusi
- Al-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir by Muhammad al-Tahir b. ‘Ashur

All knowledge of tafsir has its foundation in the work of al-Tabari, Jami’ al-Bayan. It shows one how to deal with reconciling variant opinions of the mufassirin, interplay with other ayat, and deduction of rulings, all in order to establish the correct meaning of the ayah. 

Futuh al-Ghuyub is al-Tibi’s highly regarded commentary on Al-Kashshaf by al-Zamakhshari. Al-Zamakhshari, a noted Mu’tazili, set the foundation for all linguistic tafasir after him. 

Ruh al-Ma’ani by Mahmud al-Alusi was the culmination of Ottoman scholarship on balagha. His tafsir is primarily based on Irshad al-’Aql al-Salim by Abu al-Sa’ud, which was itself drawn from the commentaries of Al-Kashshaf and Anwar al-Tanzil. Al-Alusi builds on Abu al-Sa’ud’s work, making it the backbone of his tafsir and similar to what Abu al-Sa’ud did before him, he synthesizes all the commentaries on al-Zamakhshari and al-Baydawi written up until his time. 

Al-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir by Ibn ‘Ashur is by far the greatest contemporary tafsir. Unlike many 20th century mufassirin, Ibn ‘Ashur was firmly grounded in the classical tradition, hailing from a scholarly aristocratic family of judges. The distinguishing feature of his work is his identification of ta’lil and underlining the maqasid of ayat. He also highlights rhetorical devices and reconciles different opinions. It was published between 1956 and 1970 and was the fruit of a lifetime of scholarship of the highest order.

He listed the following eight objectives for his tafsir:

- Reforming Islamic education
- Explaining correct beliefs
- Defining Quranic law
- Clarifying the policy of the Islamic community
- Analyzing the history of ancient punished community
- Demonstrating sound Quranic methods of proof and deduction
- Moral development
- Demonstrating the miraculous nature of the Quran

He was critical of most tafasir in that they are entirely dependent on previous works. Some books were so pioneering and influential to the extent that one finds entire passages copied in later works. Al-Zamakhshari’s tafsir is a prime example. Most works focusing on language after al-Zamakhshari cannot avoid engaging with it.

Ibn ‘Ashur himself emphasizes that tafsir is the art of expounding meaning and what can be deduced from it thereof. It is firmly grounded in the classical tradition, as can be deduced by his list of important tafāsīr, in focusing on linguistic analysis and Ibn ‘Ashur’s mastery of Arabic allows him to make penetrating insights in his exegesis.
