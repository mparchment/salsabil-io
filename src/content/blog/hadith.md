# Elementary Level
At this stage, Shaykh Hatim al-'Awni recommends obsessively reading the *Sahihayn*, devoting a period each day for their study so that one completes reading them in a year. One should aim to do this over four years, such as over the course of high school or university one graduates having read them several times. Once the time comes to study these books in depth, one will have a strong foundation to build upon.

- *Ma'rifat Ulum al-Hadith* by Hatim al-’Awni

Begin with this introductory text to build a solid foundation in hadith sciences. It provides a comprehensive overview of mustalah, which will prepare you for more advanced studies.
- *Al-Usus al-'Aqliyyah* by Hatim al-’Awni

This book offers insight into the rational foundations of the methodology employed by hadith scholars.

- *Al-Arba’in* by Yahya b. Sharaf al-Nawawi

This must be read with Ibn Rajab’s commentary, *Jami al-’Ulum wa’l-Hikam*. He has a clear style and often brings different variations of a narration or the statements of earlier scholars to establish the meaning of a hadith. This can be supplemented with *al-Ta’yin* by al-Tufi, who extracts important principles from the text. Hatim al-’Awni says that if someone reads these two books, he will emerge with fawa’id not found elsewhere.

- *Al-Muqidhah* by Shams al-Din al-Dhahabi

Al-Dhahabi's work is unique because it introduces the applied aspect of mustalah early on. Research the narrators mentioned by al-Dhahabi in *Tahdhib al-Kamal* by al-Mizzi and *Mizan al-I'tidal* by al-Dhahabi, taking note of the language used to describe them. Study *al-Muqidhah* with its commentaries by Abdullah al-Sa'd and Hatim al-'Awni. Supplement this with *al-Muntakhab min ‘Ilal al-Khallal* by Ibn Qudamah, which introduces what many of the topics discussed in *al-Muqidhah* look like in practice.

At this point, listen to *Tarikh Nushu' Musannafat al-Sunnah* by Sheikh Hatim al-’Awni, which consists of six lectures which offer an unparalleled understanding of the development of hadith as a field. Follow this up with *Min al-Nabi ila al-Bukhari* by Snobar, which covers the transmission and compilation of hadith from the Prophet, peace be upon him, to Imam al-Bukhari, providing important historical context.

- *‘Umdat al-Ahkam* by ‘Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi

Now one can move onto studying and memorizing famous narrations in this book, alongside reading its outstanding commentary *Ihkam al-Ahkam* by Ibn Daqiq al-‘Id, which is the greatest book ever written on applying usul al-fiqh. Listen to the recorded commentary of Hasan Bukhari. This will introduce fiqh al-hadith, as Ibn Daqiq al-‘Id deduces the rulings from each hadith in a masterful way. 

- *Al-Muwatta* by Malik b. Anas al-Madani

Study of the major hadith books should begin with those written during the age of codification and compilation, chief of which is Malik’s Muwatta. It is the briefest in length, shortest in chains, and has an excellent selection of hadith. Memorize its common chains, such as: 

- Malik – Nafi – Ibn Umar
- Hisham b. Urwa – His father – Aisha
- Zuhri – Abi Salamah b. Abd al-Rahman – Abu Hurayrah
- Abu Zinad – al-A’raj – Abu Hurayrah

Imam Malik used to revise his Muwatta’ year after year, carefully selecting which hadith were included. Due to this, there is variation between the different riwayat. Study the riwayah of al-Qa’nabi, which was preferred by most of the muhaddithin, including Imam Ahmad. 

Hatim al-’Awni recommends reading *al-Qabas* by Ibn al-’Arabi: a brief, thematic commentary on al-Muwatta in contrast to *al-Masalik* by the same author. Supplement this with Ahmad Nur Sayf’s *Amal Ahl al-Madinah*, which explains the terminology used by Imam Malik throughout al-Muwatta. Al-Shafi’i’s *Ikhtilaf Malik* is also an essential read regarding claims of Medinan consensus. 

# Intermediate Level 
The objective of this stage is to begin preparing for the thorough and exhaustive study of the major hadith literature. Throughout this stage, one should begin reading through the various sunan works to gain familiarity of their contents, while also checking and researching the veracity of their narrations. The most important sunan works are those of al-Nasa'i, which contains important benefits regarding hidden defects, and al-Tirmidhi, who had unique terminology that is often quoted by later scholars.

- *Ma’alim al-Sunnat al-Nabawiyyah* by Salih b. Ahmad al-Shami

- *Tahrir 'Ulum al-Hadith* by Abdullah b. Yusuf al-Judai'

This comprehensive work expands on what has been learned so far. Use it to compare and synthesize knowledge from previous studies. Supplement this by reading Ibn ‘Abd al-Hadi’s rasa’il on hadith. Every work of his has fawa’id: not only ittila’, but also excellent ibarat that illustrate important points of naqd. Also read Tahir al-Jaza'iri's *Tawjih al-Nazar*, which is highly recommended by contemporary experts. The author was exceptionally skilled with manuscripts, and the relevant sections in his book are indispensable to learning how to deal with them.

- *Al-Madkhal ila-'Ilm al-Sunan* by Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi

This book is al-Bayhaqi's introduction to his magisterial *al-Sunan al-Kubra*, recommended by Ahmad Ma'bad 'Abd al-Karim and Hatim al-'Awni. It consists of three parts: the first consits of central and peripheral discussions in hadith including the veracity of isolated transmission, paraphrased transmission, tadlis, the traits of a reliable narrator, and the use of mursal reports. The second part comprises discussions on legal theory including consensus, ijtihad, mafhum al-mukhalafah, and hadith which apparently contradict each other. The third part mentions the virtues of acquiring knowledge, the rank of scholars, and the etiquettes of students. 

- *Sharh al-Sunnah* by Abu’l-Qasim al-Baghawi

- *Khulasat al-Ta'sil* by Hatim al-’Awni

This book must be accompanied by the author’s recorded commentary. It is a concise treatise on the principles of criticizing and praising narrators is essential for understanding hadith evaluation. At this point, begin reading through various su'alat works:

- *Al-'Ilal wa-Ma'rifat al-Rijal li-Ahmad* by 'Abdullah b. Ahmad
- *Al-'Ilal wa-Ma'rifat al-Rijal 'an al-Imam Ahmad* by al-Marrudhi
- *Su'alat Abi Dawud li-Ahmad b. Hanbal* by Abu Dawud
- *Su'alat Abi Bakr al-Athram li-Ahmad b. Hanbal* by Abu Bakr al-Athram
- *Su'alat Abi 'Ubayd al-Ajurri li-Abi Dawud* by Abu Bakr al-Ajurri

Doing this will allow one gain more familiarity with the language used by the muhaddithin to describe narrators. At this stage, one should begin analyzing chains of transmission independently. Each chain needs to be analyzed individually and in context, understanding the approach of the early hadith masters. Continue referring to al-Mizzi's *Tahdhib al-Kamal* and al-Dhahabi's *Mizan al-I'tidal* for this purpose. One should be very careful in grading hadith and should strive to understand rather than innovate.  The final word on a narrator is with the master critics: Yahya b. Ma'in, Ahmad b. Hanbal, and Al-Bukhari.

- *Madkhal ila 'Ilm al-'Ilal* by Hatim al-’Awni

- *Kitab al-Tamyiz* by Imam Muslim

In this work, Muslim clearly details his methodology of critiquing hadith. Listen to the commentary of Abdullah al-Sa'd. This will significantly deepen one’s understanding of hadith criticism and its application. Accompany this by reading Muslim's *Muqaddimah* to his *Sahih*, where he implicitly lays out the five conditions of authenticity.

- *Al-'Illat wa-Ajnasuha* by Mustafa Bahu

As recommended by Hatim al-’Awni, read this work next to understand different types of defects in hadith. This is a highly recommended follow-up after Kitab al-Tamyiz.

- *Al-Hadith Al-Munkar* by Al-Sulaymi

In this work, al-Sulaymi performs detailed takhrij and isnad analysis, focusing on the qara'in that led certain imams to reject specific hadith. This is an important text for understanding how muhaddithin used the term shudhudh in practice.

- *Al-Hadith Al-Mu'all* and by Ali al-Sayyah

Read this along with al-Manhaj al-Ilmi, by the same author, to explore practical examples of detecting hidden defects in hadith.

- *Al-Irshadat* by Tariq Awadallah

This must be studied as an excellent and practical book that builds on the previous ‘ilal studies by focusing on mistakes that are frequently made in strengthening hadiths with mutaba’at and shawahid narrations. 

- *Al-Muharrar* by Shams al-Din b. ‘Abd al-Hadi

Although this book is primarily on ahadith al-ahkam, it should also be studied for ‘ilal, tashih, and tadh’if. Ibn ‘Abd al-Hadi was a master in hadith at a very young age. In this work he took al-Ilmam by Ibn Daqiq al-‘Id and summarized it with a focus on judging the hadith and mentioning their ‘ilal. Listen to the recorded lessons of ‘Abdulaziz al-Tarifi. 

- *Nuzhat al-Nazar* by Ibn Hajar

This work is only beneficial after a thorough understanding of mustalah. It organizes categories and connects juz' to the universals. Its most comprehensive commentary to read is al-Laqqani's Qada' al-Watar, which compiles key points and relevant sections from Muqaddimah Ibn Salah, while also quoting from the three important hawashi of Nuzhah, verbatim with references.

- *Al-Manhaj Al-Muqtarah* by Hatim al-’Awni

This study will help you develop a nuanced understanding of hadith terminology and methodology, synthesizing much of what you've learned so far.

- *Ida’at Bahthiyyah fi-‘Ulum al-Hadith al-Nabawiyyah* by Hatim al-’Awni

This book compiles some of Hatim al-‘Awni’s most important lectures on hadith sciences, serving as an advanced resource to consolidate and expand on what you’ve learned.

# Advanced Level 

The objective of this stage is to begin studying the major books of hadith with comprehensive commentary and takhrij.

- *Tarh al-Tathrib* by Wali al-Din al-’Iraqi

- *‘Ulum al-Hadith* by Ibn al-Salah

Study this seminal work on hadith sciences, along with the 112 tapes of Hatim al-’Awni’s commentary for an in-depth understanding. This book should also be read with its classical commentaries, specifically al-Iraqi’s *al-Taqyid wa’l-Idah* and Ibn Hajar’s *Nukat ‘ala Kitabayn*. 

- *Sharh 'Ilal al-Tirmidhi* by Ibn Rajab

After completing Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah, study this book and listen to al-Ta'liq 'ala Sharh 'Ilal al-Tirmidhi by Hatim al-’Awni, a 30-tape series where Sh. Hatim critiques some of Ibn Rajab's choices and covers issues not addressed in earlier works. This wonderful book helps to understand al-Tirmidhi’s use of tahsin later on.

- *Al-Risalah* by Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi’i

This text the earliest treatise on usul al-fiqh and hadith methodology. It was incredibly influential in the development of ‘ulum al-hadith in the sense that later hadith scholars took up al-Shafi’i’s arguments and further developed them. 

Before studying the text, listen to the recordings of ‘Abdullah al-Daghistani for a thematic overview and read Ahmad El-Shamsy’s The Canonization of Islamic Law, which describes the historical background of al-Shafi’i and the impact of his work. Tariq b. ‘Awad Allah’s al-Naqd al-Banna further clarifies al-Shafi’i’s conditions for accepting marasil reports from tabi’in.

- *Tanqih al-Tahqiq* by Shams al-Din b. ‘Abd al-Hadi

Read through this book by Ibn 'Abd al-Hadi to see how takhrij is practically applied. At some point, also read *Al-Sarim Al-Munki*, his refutation of al-Subki on visiting graves. Putting the fiqh of the issue aside, this is a masterclass in terms of hadith criticism. 

- *Al-Jami’ Al-Musnad Al-Sahih* by Muhammad b. Isma’il al-Bukhari

Sahih al-Bukhari takes precedence over other collections due to the extreme care the Imam al-Bukhari took in extrapolating rulings, the greatest objective in studying hadith, and its superiority over other collections in authenticity. 

The commentary to use as one's foundation is *al-Talqih li-Fahm Qari al-Sahih* by Sibt b. al-Ajami. All other commentaries on Sahih al-Bukhari seem to miss something. As for this book, the sanad of each hadith is explained well, with some points mentioned here and there. The author never misses mentioning the name when the kunyah is mentioned, and always makes tamyiz. Nusakh are discussed properly, as well as dhabt, and then gharib. A basic explanation follows where appropriate. 

Reference Ibn Rajab’s commentary *Fath al-Bari*, as well as Ibn Hajar’s famed commentary named after it. Ibn Hajar’s introduction, *Hady al-Sari*, contains many fine points of detail and criticism. He also addresses some of al-Daraqutni's objections in *al-Ilzimat*, which should also be studied with its audio commentary by Abdullah al-Sa’d. This will further introduce one to ‘ilal al-hadith, which is the most difficult aspect of ‘ulum al-hadith.

Supplement this with Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri’s Fayd al-Bari. Al-Kashmiri continuously shows how the imams differed in istinbat for a particular hadith based on differences in tanqih. The more one learns how to apply it, the more one realizes this bahth is central to all of usul. He also frequently highlights the difference between dalalah of the text and qiyas. Nur al-Din ‘Itr’s book on al-Bukhari’s headings, Al-Imam al-Bukhari wa’l-Fiqh al-Tarajim, should also be consulted. 

- *Al-Musnad Al-Sahih* by Muslim b. al-Hajjaj

Before commencing with Sahih Muslim, read Hatim al-‘Awni’s Ijma’ al-Muhaddithin, which addresses common misconceptions regarding the conditions of al-Bukhari and Muslim, as well as the mu’an’an controversy discussed in Muslim’s muqaddimah. Sahih Muslim must be accompanied by Imam al-Nawawi’s well-known commentary, Minhaj al-Muhaddithin.

Bear in mind Imam Muslim’s methodology. He arranges the hadith in each chapter according to decreasing levels of strength. Thus, the first one or two hadiths are the asl of the chapter topic or argument, of which there are 3,145, and the following hadiths are mutaba’at, from a total of 7,748. Most commentaries miss this point, focusing instead on ahkam al-hadith rather than hadith methodology. Critics have often failed to understand this subtle point and have criticized the mutabi’ hadiths when their main purpose is to support the asl hadiths. A good teacher should be able to point these out and differentiate between them. 

Another key point to note is that Imam Muslim never wrote chapter headings or titles. He simply gathered the hadiths of a particular issue together in order of strength. Later commentators wrote chapter headings, which they deduced from the contents of the hadith. Most editions of Sahih Muslim use Imam al-Nawawi’s chapter headings, due to his great standing in both fiqh and hadith. However, one should check earlier and later commentaries to see how different scholars have understood the chapters. 

-  *Al-Sunan* by Abu Dawud al-Sijistani

The Sunan of Abu Dawud should be prepared for by reading Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghuddah’s edition of his *Risalat ila Ahl Makkah*, which is one of the first treatises on nomenclature and methodology alongside Muslim’s *Muqaddimah* and al-Shafi’is *Risalah*. Abdullah al-Sa’d has an excellent audio commentary, focusing on ‘ulum al-hadith, of the opening chapters. Accompany *Sunan Abi Dawud* with *Mu’alim al-Sunan* by al-Khattabi, which is also one of the earliest commentaries on a hadith collection. 

- *Al-Jami’ Al-Kabir* by Abu ‘Isa al-Tirmidhi

The Jami’ of al-Tirmidhi should be introduced through Nur al-Din ‘Itr’s *al-Imam al-Tirmidhi*, which was his doctoral thesis at al-Azhar. Abdullah al-Sa’d has an excellent audio commentary of the opening chapters focusing on ‘ulum al-hadith. Read *‘Aridat al-Ahwadhi* by Ibn al-‘Arabi and *Taklimat Sharh al-Tirmidhi* by Zayn al-Din al-’Iraqi. Reference al-Daraqutni’s *al-‘Ilal* wherever possible.

When studying the sunan works, analyze each chain of transmission independently and strive to understand the methodology of the early hadith masters. It is crucial to remember that each chain needs to be analyzed individually and in context. Refer to the gradings and justifications of Shu’ayb al-Arna’ut and Abdullah al-Sa’d. When these two agree, it should suffice. When they differ, research it extensively. Reference ‘Ilal al-Daraqutni, ‘Ilal Ibn Abi Hatim, and ‘Ilal Ibn al-Madini. Ibn Abi Hatim only gathers the turuq, in contrast to al-Daraqutni, so his book is much more difficult to read. For this reason, Ibn Abi Hatim’s ‘ilal must be read its excellent ta’liqat by Ibn ‘Abd al-Hadi.

In addition to these structured studies, Abdullah al-Sa'd has numerous lectures on hadith narrators and jarh wal-ta'dil, although no single series. It is highly recommended to listen to everything you can find from him. As you listen to his discussions, especially in his Sharh al-Nasa'i and Sharh al-Tirmidhi, research the narrators he discusses using Tahdhib al-Tahdhib and other sources on rijal. This method will help you apply your knowledge and develop a strong grasp of these topics.

- *Al-Sunan Al-Kubra* by Ahmad b. Shu'ayb al-Nasa'i

This book is al-Nasa'i's larger collection, and it is one of the most useful books for studying 'ilal.
