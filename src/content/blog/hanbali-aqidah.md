# Elementary Level
- *Lum’at al-I’tiqad* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi: Read the transcribed commentary of *‘Abdullah al-’Abdullah*.
- *Mukhtasar al-Aqa’id* by Mubarak b. Rashid al-Hathlan:

# Intermediate Level
- *Qala’id al-Iqyan* by Ibn Balban al-Ba’li: It must be accompanied with its commentary Minhat al-Rahman by ‘Abdullah al-’Abdullah, which contains crucial details gathered from longer books across various ‘ulum. 
- *Durrat al-Madiyyah* by Muhamamd b. Ahmad al-Saffarini: This is al-Saffarini’s famed poem on aqa’id. It must be accompanied with *Mukhtasar Lawami’ al-Anwar* by Hasan al-Shatti, his summary of al-Saffarini’s much longer commentary. Supplement this with the commentary of ‘Abdullah al-’Abdullah in *al-Taqrirat al-Hanbaliyyah*. 
- *Takfir Ahl al-Shahadatayn* by Hatim b. ‘Arif al-’Awni:
- *Mafhum Shirk al-’Ibadah* by Hatim b. ‘Arif al-’Awni:
- *Aqawil al-Thiqat* by Mar’i b. Yusuf al-Karmi:
- *Hallal al-’Uqad* by Najm al-Din al-Tufi: This work is structured as a detailed commentary on Hadith Jibril. In this book, al-Tufi presents the views of other groups and assesses their evidence from an impartial perspective.  

# Advanced Level
- *Nihayat al-Mubtadi’in* by Ibn Hamdan al-Harrani: This book was authored by Ibn Hamdan to write down the aqa’id of Imam Ahmad, and it was heavily relied upon by both Ibn Muflih and al-Mardawi. Ibn Hamdan was also praised by Ibn Rajab as a master of the madhhab’s usul in fiqh and din. Use the edition of Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid, which provides the reference for each position mentioned, and listen to the recorded commentary of ‘Abdurrahman al-Salti. To understand the rationale of each qawl, it is important to read the passage it was taken from; typically from the following works:
    - *Mukhtasar al-Mu’tamad* by Abu Ya’la b. al-Farra’
    - *I’tiqad al-Imam al-Munabbal* by Abu’l-Fadl al-Tamimi
    - *Al-Irshad fi’l-I’tiqad* by Abu’l-Wafa b. ‘Aqil
    - *Al-Idah* by ‘Ali b. ‘Ubaydullah al-Zaghuni

- *Lawami’ al-Anwar* by Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Saffarini: This book is al-Saffarini magisterial commentary on Durrat al-Madiyyah.

# Mastery
- *Sharh al-Aqa’id* al-Nasafiyyah by Sa’d al-Din al-Taftazani
- *Al-'Aqidat Al-Sanusiyyah Al-Kubra* by Muhammad b. Idris al-Sanusi

# Relied-Upon Texts

In his introduction to his edition of *Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in*, Shaykh Muhammad 'Abd al-Wahid said that, "the books relied upon by the Hanabilah in studying 'aqidah, which represent the predominant approach among them, are:
- *Mukhtasar al-Mu'tamad* by Al-Qadi Abu Ya'la
- *Lum'at al-I'tiqad* by Muwaffaq [al-Din Ibn Qudamah]
- *Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in* by Ibn Hamdan
- *Al-'Ayn wa'l-Athar* by 'Abd al-Baqi al-Ba'li
- *Mukhtasar Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in* by Ibn Balban
- *Najat al-Khalaf* by Uthman al-Najdi
- *Al-Durrat Al-Madiyyah* by Al-Saffarini, along with its commentary and its commentary's abridgements by the madhhab's scholars such as Ibn Salum and Hasan al-Shatti.

Some of these books are summaries, and some do not cover every topic. However, they all align on the issues they discuss. None of them differ on the major points.

There are also books which mention the internal difference of opinion among the Hanbalis, providing a more detailed presentation of views within the madhab. Examples of such works include *Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in* by Ibn Hamdan, *Tuhfat al-Wusul* by Ibn al-Mibrad, and *Al-Durrat al-Madiyyah* by Al-Saffarini.

As for the books of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy upon him, they are not meant for methodically studying 'aqidah. They are either long treatises, answers to questions, discussions on specific topics, or refutations not restricted to theory. The scholars of the Hanbali madhhab have benefited from his books and transmit them, such as Ibn 'Atwah (948 AH), and as we see their transmission of *Minhaj al-Sunnah*, among other of his extensive books. 

The theological positions of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah are mentioned by the Hanbalis when they are within the madhhab, and they made sure to mention them, as seen with Ibn al-Mibrad, Mar'i [al-Karmi], and Al-Saffarini. They agreed with some of his views and disagreed with others.

However, the madhhab is larger than Ibn Taymiyyah, and it is too broad to be confined to the views of a single scholar even in spite of the Hanbali's reverence for Ibn Taymiyyah, their appreciation of him, and their support of him. This is whether concerning his personal opinions in 'aqidah, fiqh, or usul."
