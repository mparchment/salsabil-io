The books relied upon by the Hanabilah in studying 'aqidah, which represent the predominant approach among them, are:

- *Mukhtasar al-Mu'tamad* by Al-Qadi Abu Ya'la
- *Lum'at al-I'tiqad* by Muwaffaq [al-Din Ibn Qudamah]
- *Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in* by Ibn Hamdan
- *Al-'Ayn wa'l-Athar* by 'Abd al-Baqi al-Ba'li
- *Mukhtasar Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in* by Ibn Balban
- *Najat al-Khalaf* by Uthman al-Najdi
- *Al-Durrat Al-Madiyyah* by Al-Saffarini, along with its commentary and its commentary's abridgements by the madhhab's scholars such as Ibn Salum and Hasan al-Shatti

Some of these books are summaries, and some may do cover every topic. However, they all align on the issues they discuss. None of them differ on the major points or the key areas of contention between theological sects.

There are also books which mention the internal difference of opinion among the Hanbalis, providing a more detailed presentation of views within the madhab. Examples of such works include *Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in* by Ibn Hamdan, *Tuhfat al-Wusul* by Ibn al-Mibrad, and *Al-Durrat al-Madiyyah* by Al-Saffarini.

As for the books of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy upon him, they are not meant for methodically studying 'aqidah. They are either long treatises, answers to questions, discussions on specific topics, or refutations not restricted to theory. The scholars of the Hanbali madhhab have benefited from his books and transmit them, such as Ibn 'Atwah (948 AH), and as we see their transmission of *Minhaj al-Sunnah*, among other of his extensive books.

The theological positions of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah are mentioned by the Hanbalis when they are within the madhhab, and they made sure to mention them, as seen with Ibn al-Mibrad, Mar'i [al-Karmi], and Al-Saffarini. They agreed with some of his views and disagreed with others.

However, the madhhab is larger than Ibn Taymiyyah, and it is too broad to be confined to the views of a single scholar even in spite of the Hanbali's reverence for Ibn Taymiyyah, their appreciation of him, and their support of him. This is whether concerning his personal opinions in 'aqidah, fiqh, or usul.
