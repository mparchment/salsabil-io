# Elementary Level
- *Lum’at al-I’tiqad* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi

Read the transcribed commentary of ‘Abdullah al-’Abdullah.

- *Mukhtasar al-Aqa’id* by Mubarak b. Rashid al-Hathlan

Supplement this by reading two important works by Hatim al-'Awni: *Takfir Ahl al-Shahadatayn* and *Mafhum Shirk al-'Ibadah*.

# Intermediate Level
- *Qala’id al-Iqyan* by Ibn Balban al-Ba’li

It must be accompanied with 'Abdullah al-'Abdullah's transcribed commentary, followed by his outstanding hashiyah *Minhat al-Rahman*. *Qala'id al-Iqyan* and its longer source text, *Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in*, was written using the methodology of the mutakallimin. In his commentary, Shaykh 'Abdullah brings details gathered from longer works across various ‘ulum, and explains terminology that requires additional context. 

Complement this by reading *Aqawil al-Thiqat* by al-Karmi, along with his short treatises on issues of 'aqidah: *Tawdih al-Burhan*, *Raf' al-Shubhah*, *Tawqif al-Firiqayn*, *Tahqiq al-Burhan*, *Raf al-Talbis*, *Arwah al-Ashbah*, *al-Rawd al-Nadr*, and *Fara'id Fawa'id al-Fikr*. 

- *Mukhtasar Lawami' al-Anwar* by Hasan al-Shatti 

This is Hasan al-Shatti's summary of al-Saffarini's much longer commentary on his poem. Complement it with 'Abdullah al-'Abdullah's excellent commentary *al-Taqrirat al-Hanbaliyyah*. 

Also read *Hallal al-'Uqad* by al-Tufi, a detailed commentary on Hadith Jibril. In this book, al-Tufi presents the views of other groups and assesses their evidence from an impartial perspective. Keep in mind that the author was very independent, and he does not always privilege the relied-upon opinions of the madhhab. 

- *Al-Tabsirah* by Abu Ya'la b. al-Farra'

This book is has been mistakenly attributed to Abu Ya'la's student, al-Shirazi. It was written by Abu Ya'la after all of his other credal books, and as such, it represents his final views. Complement this by reading *al-Usul al-Mujarradah* by Ibn al-Banna', his commentary on Ibn Abi Dawud's *Ha'iyyah*.

# Advanced Level
- *Nihayat al-Mubtadi’in* by Ibn Hamdan al-Harrani

This book was authored by Ibn Hamdan to write down the aqa’id of Imam Ahmad, and it was heavily relied upon by both Ibn Muflih and al-Mardawi. Ibn Hamdan was also praised by Ibn Rajab as a master of the madhhab’s usul in fiqh and din. *Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in* itself is relatively brief, but while studying it, one should simultaneously read the original passage each position is taken from. They are typically from the following works:

- *Mukhtasar al-Mu’tamad* by Abu Ya’la b. al-Farra’
- *Ibtal al-Ta'wilat* by Abu Ya’la b. al-Farra’
- *I’tiqad al-Imam al-Munabbal* by Abu’l-Fadl al-Tamimi
- *Al-Irshad fi’l-I’tiqad* by Abu’l-Wafa b. ‘Aqil
- *Al-Idah* by ‘Ali b. ‘Ubaydullah al-Zaghuni

Use the Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid's edition of *Nihayat al-Mubtadi'in*, which provides the reference for each position mentioned, and listen to the recordings of ‘Abdurrahman al-Sallti.

- *Lawami’ al-Anwar* by Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Saffarini

This book is al-Saffarini magisterial commentary on *Durrat al-Madiyyah*. 

- *Lawa'ih al-Anwar* by Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Saffarini

This book is al-Saffarini's commentary on Ibn Abi Dawud's *Ha'iyyah*.

# Mastery

- *Al-Ibanah Al-Kubra* by Ibn Battah al-'Ukbari

- *Al-Sunnah* by Abu Bakr al-Khallal

Abu Bakr al-Khallal can be considered the founder of the Hanbali madhhab, as he was responsible for gathering the statements of Ahmad's students in both fiqh and creed.

## Ash'ari Madhhab

Truly mastering issues of 'aqidah and accurately conveying the positions of the madhhab across different frameworks requires a deep understanding of the Ash'ari school and their writings, especially due to their long-standing engagement with kalam and philosophy. Several major late Hanbali scholars formally studied Ash'ari works and wrote commentaries on them. Read through Imam al-Sanusi's series, *al-Silsilah al-'Aqdiyyah*, which takes the reader from the basics to an advanced level. For the last text, read *al-Rawd al-Anisi 'ala Kubra al-Sanusi* by Ibn 'Iwad.

Following this, read *Sharh al-Arba'in* by al-Qarafi and al-Khalwati's hashiyah on *Sharh Aqa'id al-Nasafiyyah* by al-Taftazani. For more detail, read *al-Shamil* by al-Juwayni, along with *Sharh al-Irshad* and *al-Ghunyah* by al-Ansari, one of his closest students. Al-Juwayni was a brilliant and often better at pinpointing various issues than others.
