Muwaffaq al-Din Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (620 AH) wrote in the introduction to *al-Mughni*:

> Allah appointed amongst the predecessors of this Ummah, imams from the luminaries. He paved through them the principles of Islam, and He clarified through them difficult rulings. Their agreement is clear-cut proof, and their disagreement is a vast mercy. Hearts are revived by hearing about their lives and happiness is attained by following in their footsteps.
>
> Thereafter, He specified a handful from amongst them according to their position and rank, in knowledge and piety, and preserved their mention and their schools of thought. Rulings revolve around their statements and the jurists of Islam refer to their schools to issue verdicts.
> 
> Our Imam, Abu Abdallah Ahmad b. Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, is from the highest of them in virtue, the closest in his connection to Allah, the most emulous of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and most knowledgeable of his Sunnah, the most minimal in indulging in the Dunya, and the most dedicated to voluntary worship of his Lord. For this reason, we have chosen his school.


# Elementary Level
- *Al-Aqwal Al-Mardiyyah* by Muhammad b. Sabu’ al-Dhahabi

This is the best introduction to the madhhab; it covers the sections of ‘ibadah based upon the madhhab’s relied-upon opinions, mentions basic evidence for each issue, and avoids the terse language found in other primers. 

- *‘Umdat al-Talib* by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti

This is often the first text studied with a teacher covering each bab in fiqh. It should be read with its commentary, *Hidayat al-Raghib* by Ibn Qa’id al-Najdi. He mentions qawa’id, conditions, exceptions, and basic reasoning underlying each mas'alah. These are the most important things to learn for a student before moving onto the intermediate level. 

- *Dalil al-Talib li-Nayl al-Marib* by Mar’i b. Yusuf al-Karmi

This text is widely taught throughout the Arabian Peninsula and was often memorized in the past. It is very clear and contains more detail than books of a similar size. Listen to the recordings of Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid, which are indispensable for clarifying the positions of the madhab. 

It must be read with *Fath Wahhab al-Marib* by Ibn 'Iwad al-Mardawi, which is the most comprehensive and organized commentary. Ibn 'Iwad elaborates on the text, mentions additional masa'il, defines terms, and brings important details from longer works. Although there is some overlap, also reference the commentary of 'Abdullah al-Maqdisi. He often mentions khilaf within the madhhab and tangential, yet beneficial points. For revision of the material, use *al-Ifsah* by Ibn al-Jarrah and *al-As'ilat wa'l-Ajwibah* by 'Abd al-Wahhab al-Faris.

Supplement this by reading the introductions to *al-Insaf*, *al-Furu'*, and *Tashih al-Furu'*. These provide essential knowledge surrounding the madhhab and presents the overall framework used muta’akhirin to determine the madhab’s relied-upon positions. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muhammad 'Abd al-Wahid on these introductions, which are some of the best commentary on the madhhab available. 

- *Al-Mukhtasarat Al-Usuliyyah* by Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahid al-Azhari

This is a series of texts written by the author to prepare a student for the study of usul al-fiqh. After studying this, one will be prepared to study *Mukhtasar al-Tahrir* by Ibn al-Najjar. 

- *Mukhtasar al-Tahrir* by Ibn al-Najjar al-Futuhi

Listen to the recordings of Hasan Bukhari. He is widely read in usul al-fiqh, has a deep grasp of the underlying reason for differences, and has a unique talent in explaining mutun. One should also read its commentary, *al-Dhukhr al-Harir* by Ahmad b. ‘Abdullah al-Ba’li, for more detail. Supplement this with *Taqrib al-Wusul* by Ibn Juzayy, which also covers the asbab of khilaf in fiqh. 

- *Raf’ al-Malam* by Taqi al-Din b. Taymiyyah

This book provides an introduction to the asbab of khilaf. It must be accompanied with the commentary of Yusuf al-Ghafis, which provides invaluable advice on dealing with khilaf and how to approach one’s studies. 

# Intermediate Level
- *Al-Rawd Al-Murbi’* by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti

This book is a brilliant commentary on *Zad al-Mustaqni’* by Musa al-Hajjawi. *Zad al-Mustaqni’* was itself abridged from *al-Muqni’* by Ibn Qudamah, which was written to introduce differences of opinion within the madhab. Al-Hajjawi restricted it to the madhhab’s official positions, removing rarely occurring issues and adding some of the more common ones. In contrast to *Dalil al-Talib*, which was widely studied in Sham, *Zad al-Mustaqni’* became the main text studied among Hanbalis in the Arabian Peninsula. *Zad al-Mustaqni’* is terse on its own and occasionally goes against the madhhab's relied-upon opinions, which is remedied by reading it with al-Buhuti's commentary.

There is a large amount of masa’il in this book, and it requires a long time to explain correctly. Al-Buhuti's commentary includes details on the evidence, usul al-fiqh, and qawa'id. Due to the status of the original author, the abridger, and the commentator, *Al-Rawd Al-Murbi’* has become an extremely important work for the madhhab and relied upon for both teaching and delivering legal rulings. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid and read his published edition of the book titled *Jam al-Rahiq al-Mushbi’*. For major ishkal, begin referencing the commentaries of *al-Muqni'*: *al-Mumti'*, *al-Mubdi'*, *al-Sharh al-Kabir*, and *al-Insaf*. Doing this will build one's aptitude in fiqh and facilitate understanding the expressions in these longer books. 

- *Al-Bulbul* by Najm al-Din al-Tufi

This book must be read with its commentary *Sharh Mukhtasar al-Rawdah*, which is widely regarded as one of the best works in usul al-fiqh ever written. It is the author’s commentary on his abridgement of Ibn Qudamah’s *Rawdat al-Nadhir*, itself based on al-Mustasfa by al-Ghazali. Ibn Qudamah’s *Rawdat al-Nadhir* should not be studied independently, as it was likely his personal draft of notes from *al-Mustasfa*. Al-Tufi had a unique, accessible style, and consistently shows humility in his writing. While reading, reference *al-Mustasfa*, listen to the recorded lessons of Hasan Bukhari and for revision, use *Taysir Fahm Rawdat al-Nadhir* by Majid al-’Askari, which presents the content in question-answer format. 

Supplement this by reading *Sharh Tanqih al-Fusul* by al-Qarafi and *Huli al-Taraqi* by Muhammad Fal al-Shintiqi, which is one of the best commentaries on *Maraqi al-Su'ud*. For understanding ta'lil and qiyas, read *Shifa al-'Alil* by al-Ghazali, which deals with determining the legal cause (*masalik al-'illah*).

- *Qawa'id al-Ahkam* by Izz al-Din b. 'Abd al-Salam

Ibn 'Abd al-Salam was among the first to author an independent work on maqasid. This book is important for understanding the purpose of the law and its internal rationality. Shaykh Hatim al-'Awni considers it the most important book on the topic, even more so than al-Shatibi's *al-Muwafaqat*, and suggests reading it more than once. In *al-Muwafaqat*, Al-Shatibi gives a descriptive, retrospective view of the Shari'ah and its overarching themes, from which maqasid have a prominent role. For him, it is an a posteriori exercise, and he doesn't see it having a role in application to any considerable extent. By contrast, Ibn 'Abd al-Salam is more concerned with application: going through masa'il fiqhiyyah, explaining their dimensions, and going into tafri'at and matters which are clearly contestable ijtihad. 

Keep in mind that maqasid can only be understood in practice after understanding how usul works, especially qiyas. It is simply the further study of ta'lil and its application, rather than comprising a seperate fann. Accompany this by reading *Mahasin al-Shari'ah* by al-Qaffal al-Shashi, an important work where he identifies deeper meanings behind furu' in every area of the law, including 'ibadah.

- *Sifat al-Mufti* by Ibn Hamdan al-Harrani

- *Zad al-Musafir* by Ghulam al-Khallal

In this book, the author summarized the narrations of Imam Ahmad from *al-Jami’* by Abu Bakr al-Khallal. Al-Khallal can be considered the founder of the madhab due to his efforts in collecting Ahmad’s opinions from his students and performing tarjih between them. Reading *Zad al-Musafir* will introduce one to the direct statements of the imam, and how the madhab’s opinions developed from them. Make sure to read the surviving sections of *al-Jami’* as well, where al-Khallal often makes tarjih or adds explanatory statements to the nusus of the imam.

Following this, collect and pursue all the other *masa'il* works. The most important them are the *masa'il* of'Abdullah and Abu Dawud. These are the most well-arranged and reliable. Al-Kawsaj's masa'il is also very good for the extensive tahqiq in the University of Madinah edition. It will also introduce the opinions of Ibn Rahawayh, a pillar of the muhaddithin and one of Imam Ahmad's closest peers. 

- *Tahdhib al-Ajwibah* by Ibn Hamid al-Warraq

This indispensable work must be read in order to understand how the ashab interpreted the nusus of Imam Ahmad along with the terminology that frequently come up in his fatawa. 

- *Al-’Umdah* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi

Ibn Qudamah originally authored this book as a primer in his curriculum, consisting of his ikhtiyarat from opinions within the madhhab. At this stage, it should be read with *Sharh al-’Umdah* by Ibn Taymiyyah. This commentary only covers the sections of ‘ibadah, yet it remains one of the most comprehensive works on adillah in the madhab. Ibn Taymiyyah makes it a point to mention all of the recorded positions within the madhab, along with explaining whether a position is from the riwayat, wujuh, or aqwal from the students of Ahmad. Complete this with the recorded lessons of Yusuf al-Ghafis on *al-’Umdah*. For contemporary issues, listen to the recordings of Hatem al-Haj and read his published commentary on *al-'Umdah*. 

# Advanced Level

- *Muntaha al-Iradat* by Ibn al-Najjar al-Futuhi

In this book, the author combined al-Muqni’ with *al-Tanqih al-Mushbi’* to produce a summary of the madhab’s relied-upon opinions. It must be accompanied by its commentary *Daqa’iq Uli al-Nuha* by al-Buhuti, which is one of the most authoritative books in the madhhab. One should also consult *Hashiyat Ibn Qa’id*. Begin referencing *Ghayat al-Muntaha* by Al-Karmi along with its commentaries: *Bughyat Uli al-Nuha* by Ibn al-Imad and *Matalib Uli al-Nuha* by al-Ruhaybani with *Minhat Muli al-Nuha* by Hasan al-Shatti.

- *Al-Iqna’* by Musa b. Ahmad al-Hajjawi

It must be read with its commentary *Kashaf al-Qina’* by al-Buhuti. This book, along with *Daqa’iq Uli al-Nuha*, are the reference points for finding the madhab’s relied-upon opinion. When they disagree, the latter is usually given precedence since it was written later, and if one of these two texts is unclear on an issue, the other is used to explain it. One should also reference *Hashiyat al-Khalwati*. 

- *Al-Kafi* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi

In this book, the author focuses on presenting the ta’lil of the madhhab’s positions, in contrast to *al-Muqni’* which mentions several opinions without giving tarjih. The objective of this text is to prepare the reader for ijtihad within the madhab. 

- *Al-Mufradat* by ‘Ali b. ‘Ubaydullah al-Zaghuni

This work is the one of the most extensive books in the madhhab for elaborating on its unique positions. Supplement this with *Al-Minha Al-Shafiyyah* by al-Buhuti, his commentary of Ibn ‘Abd al-Qawi’s poem on Hanbali mufradat. 

- *Jam’ al-Jawami’* by Taj al-Din al-Subki

Listen to the recorded lessons of Hasan Bukhari and read his published edition with Amir Bahjat titled *al-Haqibah al-Ta'limiyyah*. This book should also be accompanied with its commentary *Tashnif al-Masami’* by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi. He was a talented compiler who knew how to sift through opinions and engage with the written tradition. 

- *Al-Tahbir* by ‘Ala al-Din al-Mardawi

- *Al-Bahr Al-Muhit* by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi

Similar to *al-Tahbir*, this book is an encyclopedia and the last truly great work written on usul al-fiqh. Nothing after comes close to its scope and depth. Also read al-Zarkashi’s *Salasil al-Dhahab*, which presents issues not typically found in books of usul al-fiqh.

- *Dawabit Sarf al-Amr wa’l-Nahy* by Khalid al-Otaybi

This book will explain which qara’in to take into consideration for sarf of amr and nahy to wujub and tahrim. This is one of most important topics in usul al-fiqh, but is never addressed in the books of usul, fiqh, or hadith. 

- *Dar al-Qawl al-Qabih* by Najm al-Din al-Tufi

This work is important for understanding the relationship between ‘aqidah and issues in usul al-fiqh. Supplement it with *al-Masa’il al-Mushtarikah* by Muhammad al-’Arusi.

- *‘Iqd al-Mandhum* by Shihab al-Din al-Qarafi

This text deals with all the asbab of ‘umum.

- *Al-Ghiyathi* by Abu'l-Ma'ali al-Juwayni

This book by al-Juwayni is one the most comprehensive works on imamah and siyasah shar'iyyah. Supplement it with *al-Ihkam* by al-Qarafi, which was written to clarify the difference between the legal opinions of a mufti, the rulings of a qadi, and the decisions of a ruler. 

- *Al-Qawa’id* by ‘Ala al-Din Ibn al-Lahham

At this juncture, one should begin the study of takhrij al-furu’ ‘ala al-usul, which demonstrates how usul al-fiqh is practically applied to furu’. Ibn al-Lahham mentions al-qawa’id al-usuliyyah and demonstrates how furu’ are built upon them. Supplement this with *Takhrij al-Furu’ ‘ala al-Usul* by Uthman Shushan. Shushan relies on many different sources and brings examples from Ibn Qudamah’s *al-Mughni*, making it one of the most comprehensive works on the subject. 

- *Idah al-Dala’il* by Sharaf al-Din al-Zarirani

One should commence the study of furuq with this work by al-Zarirani, the shaykh of al-Tufi and al-Dujayli. This book will serve as an excellent tool for understanding ta’lil and furuq.

- *Taqrir al-Qawa’id* by Zayn al-Din Ibn Rajab

# Mastery 
- *Al-Muqni’* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi

One should aim for mastery, which entails being able to independently arrive at the same conclusions the imams of the madhab have reached. Read the following commentaries simultaneously: 

- *Al-Mutli’* by Shams al-Din b. Abi al-Fath
- *Al-Mumti’* by Abu’l-Barkat b. al-Munajja
- *Al-Shafi* by Shams al-Din b. Abi ‘Umar: Better known as *al-Sharh al-Kabir*, this book was written by Ibn Abi ‘Umar as a rearrangement of *al-Mughni*, authored by his uncle Ibn Qudamah, based on the organization of *al-Muqni’*. The original work is considered one of the most comprehensive books in fiqh ever written, allowing one to observe every aspect of using, debating, defending, and deconstructing qiyas. 
- *Al-Mubdi’* by Burhan al-Din b. Muflih
- *Al-Insaf* by ‘Ala al-Din al-Mardawi: *Al-Insaf* is the encyclopedia of internal Hanbali differences, with the relied-upon view being highlighted. Imam al-Mardawi marks the final stage of development for the madhab and he is referred to as al-Murajjih, al-Musahhih, and al-Munaqqih depending where he is quoted from. 

*Al-Mumti’* largely focuses on istidlal and niqash, *al-Insaf* on naql of the madhab, *al-Shafi* on adillah, while *al-Mubdi’* strikes a balance between istidlal and naql. Both *al-Insaf* and *al-Sharh al-Kabir* were influential on later scholars for istidlal of the madhab. Together, these books provide a balance between studying khilaf ‘ali, which widens ones perspective, and khilaf nazil, which deepens one’s understanding of each far’ and the subtitles of ta’lil. It is impossible, with some semblance of objectivity, to delve into works of istidlalat and khilaf 'ali and come out still holding to all of the madhab’s relied-upon positions. However, doing this will increase one’s respect for the genius of the madhab’s imams and their overall approach.

- Al-Muharrar by Majd al-Din b. Taymiyyah

Read it with *Al-Nukat wa'l-Fawa'id* by Ibn Muflih, *Hashiyat Ibn Qundus*, *Hashiyat Ibn Nasrullah*, and *Sharh al-Muharrar* by Ibn 'Abd al-Haqq.

- *Al-Furu* by Shams al-Din b. Muflih

It should be read with *Tashih al-Furu* by 'Ala al-Din al-Mardawi, *Hashiyat Ibn Qundus*, and *Hashiyat Ibn Nasrullah*.

- *Tahsin al-Ma'akhidh* by Abu Hamid al-Ghazali

- *Al-Burhan* by Abu'l-Ma'ali al-Juwayni

This book the most in-depth work written on usul al-fiqh, but also difficult to understand. The author had the best grip on the ma'akhidh and madakhil of the funun of any scholar from his era. It should be read with al-Abyari's commentary *al-Tahqiq wa'l-Bayan*, accompanied by the surviving portions of al-Maziri's commentary *Idah al-Mahsul*. Also read *al-Taqrib wa'l-Irshad* by al-Baqillani, who was influential on both al-Juwayni and al-Ghazali after him. 

## Shafi'i Madhhab

Imam Ahmad lauded al-Shafi’i for canonizing the framework ahl al-hadith employed to extract rulings from the nusus and often recommended studying his works. Read *al-Umm* by Imam al-Shafi’i and *Nihayat al-Matlab* by al-Juwayni. *Nihayat al-Matlab* is one of the greatest works in fiqh ever written, where the author clearly explains the ta’lilat and shows how the furu’ of a bab tie back to the ta’lil of its usul. Al-Shafi'i similarly begins each chapter with evidence and branches out from there. His reasoning is of higher quality and more transparent than what later fiqh texts tend to provide.

*Al-Wasit* by al-Ghazali should be studied. It is one of the greatest mutun authored in any madhhab due to the way it was written. It was a popular teaching text for early Shafi'i's, and al-Nawawi is said to have read it hundreds of times. Al-Ghazali's works based on *Nihayat al-Matlab*, among them *al-Wasit*, are critical abridgements and partial reworkings. He is not just abridging the text, but also rearranging some of its discussions and changing how some of the information is presented, alongside mentioning his own tarjihat. *Al-Wasit* is clear, well structured, and gives one a good idea about the reasoning of the madhhab. It has many commentaries, but can be read on its own. 

For more detail in the madhhab, reference the works of al-Rafi'i and al-Nawawi: *al-'Aziz*, *Rawdat al-Talibin*, which is al-Nawawi's critical abridgement of *al-'Aziz*, and *al-Majmu'*, al-Nawawi's commentary on *al-Muhadhdhab*. Both *al-Majmu'* and *al-'Aziz* book provides dalil, ta'lil, tafri', and discussion of both internal and external disagreements. In *al-'Aziz*, al-Rafi'i had a habit of picking up useful ideas from *Nihayat al-Matlab* that al-Ghazali left out of *al-Wasit* and it is said that when Ibn Daqiq al-'Id got a hold of the book, he only performed the fara'id until he finished reading it. Also reference *al-Awsat* by Ibn al-Mundhir, which is one of the earliest works on khilaf. The author was an independent jurist in his own right and his works were relied upon by Ibn Qudamah for the composition of *al-Mughni*. 

## Maliki Madhhab

Imam Ahmad often redirected questioners towards the circles of the Medinans. Before commencing with the Maliki madhab, read *Tasmiyat wa’l-Hikayat* by al-Saraqusti. This early book on tabaqat sheds light on how a madhab is built and evolves, politics and issues between scholars, along with how and why certain books become relied upon in the madhab. Then read *al-Mudawwanah* by Shanun, which gathers the statements of Malik and his students, along with *al-Dhakhirah* by al-Qarafi. One must also study *Sharh al-Talqin* by al-Mazari, his outstanding commentary on *al-Talqin* by Qadi 'Abd al-Wahhab. This book will expose the legal reasoning of 'Iraqi Malikis, who often had to justify the madhhab's positions in the light of hadith. 

The encyclopedic commentaries of Maliki scholars on the Qur'an and hadith are also important: *al-Jami' li-Ahkam al-Qur'an* by al-Qurtubi and *al-Istidhkar* by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr. *Al-Mu'lim* by al-Maziri is a brilliant and concise commentary on *Sahih Muslim*. *Sharh al-Zarqani* can be used as a quick reference for the relied-upon opinions of each madhhab. To gain perspective on the reasonings behind the furu'i furuq in ahkam, read *al-Furuq* by al-Qarafi.

## Hanafi Madhhab

Imam Ahmad’s first teacher was Qadi Abu Yusuf, under whom he began seeking fiqh and hadith. Read *Kitab al-Asl* and *Kitab al-Hujjah* by Muhammad b. Hasan al-Shaybani. *Kitab al-Asl* is arguably the most important work in the history of fiqh for its impact on those who came after, including the other schools. Then read *Sharh Mukhtasar al-Tahawi* by al-Jassas, *Sharh Mukhtasar al-Karkhi* by al-Quduri, which contains beneficial furu'i fawa'id, and *Fath al-Qadir* by Ibn al-Hummam. Also reference *Bada’i al-Sana’i* by al-Kasani for fiqh al-khilaf and al-Tahawi's *Sharh Ma'ani al-Athar* for commentary on hadith.
