Muwaffaq al-Din Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (620 AH) wrote in the introduction to *al-Mughni*:

> Allah appointed amongst the predecessors of this Ummah, imams from the luminaries. He paved through them the principles of Islam, and He clarified through them difficult rulings. Their agreement is clear-cut proof, and their disagreement is a vast mercy. Hearts are revived by hearing about their lives and happiness is attained by following in their footsteps.
>
> Thereafter, He specified a handful from amongst them according to their position and rank, in knowledge and piety, and preserved their mention and their schools of thought. Rulings revolve around their statements and the jurists of Islam refer to their schools to issue verdicts.
> 
> Our Imam, Abu Abdallah Ahmad b. Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, is from the highest of them in virtue, the closest in his connection to Allah, the most emulous of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and most knowledgeable of his Sunnah, the most minimal in indulging in the Dunya, and the most dedicated to voluntary worship of his Lord. For this reason, we have chosen his school.


# Elementary Level
The purpose of this level is to gain a sound conceptualization of the masa'il in each chapter of fiqh.

- *‘Umdat al-Talib* by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti

This is often the first text studied with a teacher covering every bab in fiqh. Read its excellent commentary, *Hidayat al-Raghib* by Ibn Qa’id al-Najdi and use *Ihkam al-Dhari'ah* by al-Surramari to become familiar with the ayat and hadith that the furu' are extracted from. A teacher should read from *Fath Mawla al-Mawahib*, Ibn Iwad's hashiyah on *Hidayat al-Raghib*. Use *al-Qawa'id al-Kulliyyah* by Ibn al-Mibrad to memorize conditions, pillars, and categorizations. 

Before covering a chapter in *'Umdat al-Talib*, read it *al-Aqwal al-Mardiyyah* by Muhammad b. Sabu' al-Dhahabi. This book is the clearest introductory work on the Hanbali madhhab. Based on the style of Ibn Qudamah's *Umdah*, it covers the sections of ‘ibadah based upon the madhhab’s relied-upon opinions, mentions basic evidence for each issue, and avoids the terse language found in other primers.

- *Dalil al-Talib li-Nayl al-Marib* by Mar’i b. Yusuf al-Karmi

This text is widely taught throughout the Arabian Peninsula and was often memorized in the past. It is very clear and contains more detail than books of a similar size. Listen to the recordings of Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid, which are indispensable for clarifying the positions of the madhab. Read the published edition of Mustafa b. Rashid al-Hathlan.

It must be read with *Fath Wahhab al-Marib* by Ibn 'Iwad al-Mardawi, which is the most comprehensive and organized commentary. Ibn 'Iwad elaborates on the text, mentions additional masa'il, defines terms, and brings important details from longer works. Although there is some overlap, also reference the commentary of 'Abdullah al-Maqdisi. He often mentions khilaf within the madhhab and tangential, yet beneficial points. While covering inheritance, read *al-Fara'id* by Salih al-Shami and practice using *al-Tadribat al-Mudiyyah* by Bajabir. For revision of the masa'il, use *al-Ifsah* by Ibn al-Jarrah and *al-As'ilat wa'l-Ajwibah* by 'Abd al-Wahhab al-Faris.

Supplement this by reading the introductions to *al-Insaf*, *al-Furu'*, and *Tashih al-Furu'*. These provide essential knowledge surrounding the madhhab and presents the overall framework used muta’akhirin to determine the madhab’s relied-upon positions. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muhammad 'Abd al-Wahid on these introductions, which are some of the best commentary on the madhhab available. 

- *Al-Mukhtasarat Al-Usuliyyah* by Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahid al-Azhari

This is a series of texts written by the Muhammad 'Abd al-Wahid to prepare a student for the study of usul al-fiqh. After studying this, one will be prepared to study *Mukhtasar al-Tahrir* by Ibn al-Najjar. Listen to the recorded lessons of the author. Supplement it with *Taysir Usul al-Fiqh* by 'Abdullah al-Juday'. 

- *Mukhtasar al-Tahrir* by Shihab al-Din b. al-Najjar

The author wrote this text as an abridgement *Tahrir al-Manqul* by al-Mardawi, with similar coverage to *Jam al-Jawami’*. Listen to the recordings of Hasan Bukhari. He is widely read in usul al-fiqh, has a deep grasp of the underlying reason for differences, and has a unique talent in explaining mutun. For more detail at this level, read its commentary *al-Dhukhr al-Harir* by Ahmad b. ‘Abdullah al-Ba’li. Supplement this with *Taqrib al-Wusul* by Ibn Juzayy, which is beneficial in that it also covers the asbab of khilaf. 

- *Raf’ al-Malam* by Taqi al-Din b. Taymiyyah

This book provides an introduction to the asbab of khilaf. It must be accompanied with the commentary of Yusuf al-Ghafis, which provides invaluable advice on dealing with khilaf and how to approach one’s studies. 

- *Mukhtasar Tabaqat al-Hanabilah* by Jamil al-Shatti

# Intermediate Level
The purpose of this level is to understand the madhhab's positions in the context of usul al-fiqh and its qawa'id. 

- *Al-Rawd Al-Murbi’* by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti

This book is a brilliant commentary on *Zad al-Mustaqni’* by Musa al-Hajjawi. *Zad al-Mustaqni’* was itself abridged from *al-Muqni’* by Ibn Qudamah, which was written to introduce differences of opinion within the madhab. Al-Hajjawi restricted it to the madhhab’s official positions, removing rarely occurring issues and adding some of the more common ones. In contrast to *Dalil al-Talib*, which was widely studied in Sham, *Zad al-Mustaqni’* became the main text studied among Hanbalis in the Arabian Peninsula. *Zad al-Mustaqni’* is terse on its own and occasionally goes against the madhhab's relied-upon opinions, which is remedied by reading it with al-Buhuti's commentary.

There is a large amount of masa’il in this book, and it requires a long time to explain correctly. In our times, it is typically the last book studied cover-to-cover with a teacher. Al-Buhuti's commentary includes details on the evidence, usul al-fiqh, and qawa'id. Due to the status of the original author, the abridger, and the commentator, *Al-Rawd Al-Murbi’* has become an extremely important work for the madhhab and relied upon for both teaching and delivering legal rulings. Complete listening to the recorded lessons of Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid on *Zad al-Mustaqni'* first, then watch his recordings on *Al-Rawd Al-Murbi'*. Use his commentary on *al-Rawd* titled *Jam al-Rahiq al-Mushbi’*, which encompasses all other hawamish on *al-Rawd*. While studying the inheritance, read *al-Badraniyyah* by Ibn Badran.

For major ishkal, begin referencing the commentaries of *al-Muqni'*: *al-Mumti'*, *al-Mubdi'*, *al-Sharh al-Kabir*, and *al-Insaf*. Doing this will build one's aptitude in fiqh and facilitate understanding the expressions in these longer books.

- *Al-’Umdah* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi

Ibn Qudamah originally authored this book as a primer in his curriculum, consisting of his tarjihat of opinions within the madhhab. At this stage, *al-Umdah* should be read with *Sharh al-’Umdah*, an early work of Ibn Taymiyyah. It only covers the chapters of ‘ibadat, yet it remains one of the most comprehensive works on adillah in the madhab. Ibn Taymiyyah makes it a point to mention all of the recorded positions within the madhab, along with explaining whether a position is from the riwayat, wujuh, or aqwal from the students of Ahmad. Complete this with *al-'Uddah* by Baha al-Din al-Maqdisi, a student of the author and *al-'Umdah*'s most authoritative commentator. 

Listen to the recorded lessons of Yusuf al-Ghafis on *al-’Umdah*, which focuses on fiqh al-khilaf. For contemporary issues, use the recordings of Hatem al-Haj with his published commentary on *al-'Umdah* along with Ibn Jibrin's commentary.  

At this point, read *al-Fawakih al-Adidah* by al-Manqur, which collects qawa'id, khilaf, and other beneficial points from scholars across the madhahib, and *Maratib al-Ijma'* by Ibn Hazm with its naqd by Ibn Taymiyyah and footnotes by al-Kawthari. Ibn Hazm's book is one of the most important works on documenting issues of consensus. 

- *Al-Bulbul* by Najm al-Din al-Tufi

This book must be read with its commentary *Sharh Mukhtasar al-Rawdah*, which is widely regarded as one of the best works in usul al-fiqh ever written. It is the author’s commentary on his abridgement of Ibn Qudamah’s *Rawdat al-Nadhir*, itself based on al-Mustasfa by al-Ghazali. Ibn Qudamah’s *Rawdat al-Nadhir* should not be studied independently, as it was likely his personal draft of notes from *al-Mustasfa*. Al-Tufi had a unique, accessible style, and consistently shows humility in his writing. While reading, reference *al-Mustasfa*, listen to the recorded lessons of Hasan Bukhari and for revision, use *Taysir Fahm Rawdat al-Nadhir* by Majid al-’Askari, which presents the content in question-answer format. 

Supplement this by reading *Sharh Tanqih al-Fusul* by al-Qarafi and *Huli al-Taraqi* by Muhammad Fal al-Shintiqi, which is one of the best commentaries on *Maraqi al-Su'ud*. For understanding ta'lil and qiyas, read *Shifa al-Ghalil* by al-Ghazali, which deals with determining the legal cause (*masalik al-'illah*). This is crucial to understand before moving on to more advanced works.

- *Al-Qawa'id Al-Ahkam* by Izz al-Din b. 'Abd al-Salam

Ibn 'Abd al-Salam was among the first to author an independent work on maqasid. This book is important for understanding the purpose of the law and its internal rationality. Shaykh Hatim al-'Awni considers it the most important book on the topic, even more so than al-Shatibi's *al-Muwafaqat*, and suggests reading it more than once. In *al-Muwafaqat*, Al-Shatibi gives a descriptive, retrospective view of the Shari'ah and its overarching themes, from which maqasid have a prominent role. For him, it is an a posteriori exercise, and he doesn't see it having a role in application to any considerable extent. By contrast, Ibn 'Abd al-Salam is more concerned with going through masa'il fiqhiyyah, explaining their dimensions, and going into tafri'at and matters which are clearly contestable ijtihad. 

Keep in mind that maqasid can only be understood in practice only after understanding how usul works, especially qiyas. It is simply the further study of ta'lil and its application, rather than comprising a seperate fann. Also read *Mahasin al-Shari'ah* by al-Qaffal al-Shashi, an important work where he identifies deeper meanings behind furu' in every area of the law, including 'ibadah. Some of the meanings underlying the law which he identifies are contingent on the specific positions he takes as being correct. Nonetheless, his work is important for understanding that if we cannot provide an elegant and coherent of how something fits into the larger picture of the law, that could be a sign of an error in the premise.

- *Al-Risalah* by Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi’i

This text the earliest treatise on usul al-fiqh and hadith methodology. Al-Shafi'i authored the *Risalah* after 'Abdurrahman b. al-Mahdi requested that he write a book that would serve as a sort of arbitrator between ahl al-hadith and ahl al-ra'y; a hermeneutical constitution that would be based on what both sides agreed on. As a result, all later work of usul al-fiqh can be considered footnotes to al-Shafi'is *Risalah*. It was also incredibly influential in the development of ‘ulum al-hadith, in the sense that later hadith scholars took up al-Shafi’i’s arguments and further developed them. 

Before studying the text, listen to the recordings of ‘Abdullah al-Daghistani for a thematic overview and read Ahmad El-Shamsy’s The Canonization of Islamic Law, which describes the historical background of al-Shafi’i and the impact of his work. Tariq b. ‘Awad Allah’s *al-Naqd al-Banna* further clarifies al-Shafi’i’s conditions for accepting marasil reports from tabi’in. Al-Shafi’i’s *Ikhtilaf Malik* is also an essential read regarding claims of Medinan consensus. 

- *Sifat al-Mufti* by Ibn Hamdan al-Harrani

- *Zad al-Musafir* by Ghulam al-Khallal

In this book, the author summarized the narrations of Imam Ahmad from *al-Jami’* by Abu Bakr al-Khallal. Al-Khallal can be considered the founder of the madhab due to his efforts in collecting Ahmad’s opinions from his students and performing tarjih between them. Reading *Zad al-Musafir* will introduce one to the direct statements of the imam, and how the madhab’s opinions developed from them. Make sure to read the surviving sections of *al-Jami’* as well, where al-Khallal often makes tarjih or adds explanatory statements to the nusus of the imam. Follow this up with *Tahdhib al-Ajwibah* by Ibn Hamid, which must be read in order to understand how the ashab interpreted the nusus of Imam Ahmad along with the terminology that frequently come up in his fatawa.

Collect and pursue all the other *masa'il* works as well. The most important them are those of'Abdullah and Abu Dawud, which are the most well-arranged and reliable. Al-Kawsaj's collection is also very good for the extensive tahqiq in the University of Madinah edition. It also introduce the opinions of Ibn Rahawayh, a pillar of ahl al-hadith and one of Imam Ahmad's closest peers. Ibn Taymiyyah mentions that many of the early muhaddithun had a juristic inclination very similiar to that of Imam Ahmad, and that their opinions are often in line with his.

# Advanced Level

- *Muntaha al-Iradat* by Ibn al-Najjar al-Futuhi

In this book, the author combined al-Muqni’ with *al-Tanqih al-Mushbi’* to produce a summary of the madhab’s relied-upon opinions. It must be accompanied by its commentary *Daqa’iq Uli al-Nuha* by al-Buhuti, which is the most authoritative book in the madhhab. It was al-Buhuti's last work, written a few years after *Kashshaf al-Qina*. One should also consult *Hashiyat Ibn Qa’id*, a student of *al-Khalwati*, who also wrote a commentary on *Muntaha al-Iradat*. Begin referencing *Ghayat al-Muntaha* by Al-Karmi along with its commentaries: *Bughyat Uli al-Nuha* by Ibn al-Imad and *Matalib Uli al-Nuha* by al-Ruhaybani with *Minhat Muli al-Nuha* by Hasan al-Shatti. Keep in mind that while *Ghayat al-Muntaha* is a very important book in the madhhab, not all awjuh within it are accepted or align with the positions of al-Buhuti.

- *Al-Iqna’* by Musa b. Ahmad al-Hajjawi

It must be read with its commentary *Kashaf al-Qina’* by al-Buhuti. This book, along with *Daqa’iq Uli al-Nuha*, are the reference points for finding the madhab’s relied-upon opinion. When they disagree, the latter is usually given precedence since it was written later, apart from a few issues. If one of the two is unclear on something, then the other is used to explain it. Reference *Hashiyat al-Khalwati* alongside al-Buhuti’s commentary. 

Supplement this by reading *al-Kafi* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi. In this book, he presents the ta'lil of the madhhab's positions, in contrast to *al-Muqni’* which mentions several opinions without giving tarjih. Also read *al-Mufradat* by ‘Ali b. ‘Ubaydullah al-Zaghuni, which is one of the most extensive books in the madhhab for elaborating on its unique positions. Another beneficial work is *al-Minha al-Shafiyyah* by al-Buhuti, his commentary of Ibn 'Abd al-Qawi's poem on the mufradat of the madhhab. For mastering inheritance, read *al-'Adhb al-Fa'id* by al-Shamarri, his commentary of Salih b. Hasan al-Buhuti's alfiyyah on fara'id.

- *Jam’ al-Jawami’* by Taj al-Din al-Subki

Listen to the recorded lessons of Hasan Bukhari and read his published edition with Amir Bahjat titled *al-Haqibah al-Ta'limiyyah*. This book should also be accompanied with its commentary *Tashnif al-Masami’* by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi. He was a talented compiler who knew how to sift through opinions and engage with the written tradition. Also read *Ikhtilaf al-Muftin* by Hatim al-'Awni.

- *Al-Tahbir* by ‘Ala al-Din al-Mardawi

Supplement this with *al-Bahr al-Muhit* by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi. Similar to *al-Tahbir*, this book is an encyclopedia and the last truly great work written on usul al-fiqh. Nothing after comes close to its scope and depth, and Shaykh Ahmad Ma'bad 'Abd al-Karim recommends studying it due to the amount of usul al-hadith it has. Also study al-Zarkashi’s *Salasil al-Dhahab*, which presents issues not typically found in books of usul al-fiqh, and *Dar al-Qawl al-Qabih* by al-Tufi, which is important for understanding the relationship between ‘aqidah and masa'il in usul al-fiqh. Finally, read *‘Iqd al-Mandhum* by al-Qarafi, which explains the various asbab of 'umum.

- *Al-Ghiyathi* by Abu'l-Ma'ali al-Juwayni

This book by al-Juwayni is one the most comprehensive works on imamah and siyasah shar'iyyah. Supplement it with *al-Ihkam* by al-Qarafi, which was written to clarify the difference between the legal opinions of a mufti, the rulings of a qadi, and the decisions of a ruler. 

- *Al-Qawa’id* by ‘Ala al-Din Ibn al-Lahham

At this juncture, one should begin learning how usul al-fiqh is practically applied to furu’, which is known as takhrij al-furu’ ‘ala al-usul. In this book, Ibn al-Lahham mentions al-qawa’id al-usuliyyah and demonstrates how furu’ are built upon them. 

Supplement this with *Takhrij al-Furu’ ‘ala al-Usul* by Uthman Shushan. He relies on many different sources and brings examples from Ibn Qudamah’s *al-Mughni*, making it one of the most comprehensive works on the subject. Also read *Dawabit Sarf al-Amr wa'l-Nahi* by Khalid al-Otaybi*. This book will explain which qara’in to take into consideration for sarf of amr and nahy to wujub and tahrim. This is among the important topics in usul al-fiqh, but is never addressed in the books of usul, fiqh, or hadith. 

- *Idah al-Dala’il* by Sharaf al-Din al-Zarirani

One should commence the study of furuq with this work by al-Zarirani, the shaykh of al-Tufi and al-Dujayli. This book serves as an excellent tool for understanding ta’lil and furuq.

- *Taqrir al-Qawa’id* by Zayn al-Din Ibn Rajab

- *Tabaqat al-Hanabilah* by Ibn Abi Ya'la 

Follow this up with *Dhayl Tabaqat al-Hanabilah* by Ibn Rajab and *Dhayl Tabaqat Ibn Rajab* by Ibn al-Mibrad.

# Mastery 
- *Al-Muqni’* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi

This book was often memorized by the Mutawasit scholars of the madhhab. One should aim for mastery, which entails being able to independently arrive at the same conclusions the imams of the madhab have reached. Read the following commentaries simultaneously: 

- *Al-Mutli’* by Shams al-Din b. Abi al-Fath
- *Al-Mumti’* by Abu’l-Barkat b. al-Munajja
- *Al-Shafi* by Shams al-Din b. Abi ‘Umar: Better known as *al-Sharh al-Kabir*, this book was written by Ibn Abi ‘Umar as a rearrangement of *al-Mughni*, authored by his uncle Ibn Qudamah, based on the organization of *al-Muqni’*. The original work is considered one of the most comprehensive books in fiqh ever written, allowing one to observe every aspect of using, debating, defending, and deconstructing qiyas. 
- *Al-Mubdi’* by Burhan al-Din b. Muflih
- *Al-Insaf* by ‘Ala al-Din al-Mardawi: *Al-Insaf* is the encyclopedia of internal Hanbali differences, with the relied-upon view being highlighted. Imam al-Mardawi marks the final stage of development for the madhab and he is referred to as al-Murajjih, al-Musahhih, and al-Munaqqih depending where he is quoted from. 

*Al-Mumti’* largely focuses on istidlal and niqash, *al-Insaf* on naql of the madhab, *al-Shafi* on adillah, while *al-Mubdi’* strikes a balance between istidlal and naql. Both *al-Insaf* and *al-Sharh al-Kabir* were influential on later scholars for istidlal of the madhab. Together, these books provide a balance between studying khilaf ‘ali, which widens ones perspective, and khilaf nazil, which deepens one’s understanding of each far’ and the subtitles of ta’lil. It is impossible, with some semblance of objectivity, to delve into works of istidlalat and khilaf 'ali and come out still holding to all of the madhab’s relied-upon positions. However, doing this will increase one’s respect for the genius of the madhab’s scholars and their overall approach.

- Al-Muharrar by Majd al-Din b. Taymiyyah

Read it with *Al-Nukat wa'l-Fawa'id* by Ibn Muflih, *Hashiyat Ibn Qundus*, *Hashiyat Ibn Nasrullah*, and *Sharh al-Muharrar* by Ibn 'Abd al-Haqq.

- *Al-Furu'* by Shams al-Din b. Muflih

It should be read with *Tashih al-Furu* by 'Ala al-Din al-Mardawi, *Hashiyat Ibn Qundus*, and *Hashiyat Ibn Nasrullah*.

- *Tahsin al-Ma'akhidh* by Abu Hamid al-Ghazali

- *Al-Burhan* by Abu'l-Ma'ali al-Juwayni

This book the most in-depth work written on usul al-fiqh, but also difficult to understand. The author had the best grip on the ma'akhidh and madakhil of the funun of any scholar from his era. Preface it by reading *Kitab al-Talkhis*, al-Juwayni's abridgement of *al-Taqrib wa'l-Irshad* by al-Baqillani, who was al-Juywani's teacher and a major influence on him. Study *al-Burhan* with with al-Abyari's commentary *al-Tahqiq wa'l-Bayan*, along with the surviving portion of al-Maziri's commentary *Idah al-Mahsul*. 

The various madhahib are essentially smaller niches in an overarching umbrella that are compartmentalized based on juristic propensities, inclinations, and proclivities, as well as scholars tending to agree with a large part of their body of furu', which usually stems from being in line with said imam's juristic proclivities, more than they are separated by black-and-white differences in their methodologies. The various madhhabs should not be understood as self-contained and sealed off from each other. Once one has mastered one madhhab, the next step is to study the original sources and major works of the others.

## Shafi'i Madhhab

Imam Ahmad lauded al-Shafi’i for canonizing the framework ahl al-hadith employed to extract rulings from the nusus and often recommended studying his works. Read *al-Umm* by Imam al-Shafi’i and *Nihayat al-Matlab* by al-Juwayni. *Nihayat al-Matlab* is one of the greatest works in fiqh ever written, where the author clearly explains the ta’lilat and shows how the furu’ of a bab tie back to the ta’lil of its usul. Al-Shafi'i similarly begins each chapter with evidence and branches out from there. His reasoning is of higher quality and more transparent than what later fiqh texts tend to provide.

*Al-Wasit* by al-Ghazali should be studied. It is one of the greatest mutun authored in any madhhab due to the way it was written. It was a popular teaching text for early Shafi'i's, and al-Nawawi is said to have read it hundreds of times. Al-Ghazali's works based on *Nihayat al-Matlab* are critical abridgements and partial reworkings, among them *al-Wasit*. He is not just abridging the text, but also rearranging some of its discussions and changing how some of the information is presented, alongside mentioning his own tarjihat. *Al-Wasit* is clear, well structured, and gives one a good idea about the reasoning of the madhhab. It has many commentaries, but can be read on its own. 

For more detail in the madhhab, reference the works of al-Rafi'i and al-Nawawi: *al-'Aziz*, *Rawdat al-Talibin*, which is al-Nawawi's critical abridgement of *al-'Aziz*, and *al-Majmu'*, al-Nawawi's commentary on *al-Muhadhdhab*. Both *al-Majmu'* and *al-'Aziz* book provides dalil, ta'lil, tafri', and discussion of both internal and external disagreements. In *al-'Aziz*, al-Rafi'i had a habit of picking up useful ideas from *Nihayat al-Matlab* that al-Ghazali left out of *al-Wasit* and it is said that when Ibn Daqiq al-'Id got a hold of the book, he only performed the fara'id until he finished reading it. Also reference *al-Awsat* by Ibn al-Mundhir, which is one of the earliest works on khilaf and one of the most imporant books for determining ijma'. The author was an independent jurist in his own right and his works were relied upon by Ibn Qudamah for the composition of *al-Mughni*. 

## Maliki Madhhab

Imam Ahmad often redirected questioners towards the circles of the Medinans. Before commencing with the Maliki madhab, read *Tasmiyat wa’l-Hikayat* by al-Saraqusti. This early book on tabaqat sheds light on how a madhab is built and evolves, politics and issues between scholars, along with how and why certain books become relied upon in the madhab. Then read *al-Mudawwanah* by Sahnun, which gathers the statements of Malik and his students, along with *al-Dhakhirah* by al-Qarafi. One must also study *Sharh al-Talqin* by al-Mazari, his outstanding commentary on *al-Talqin* by Qadi 'Abd al-Wahhab. This book will expose the legal reasoning of 'Iraqi Malikis, who often had to justify the madhhab's positions in the light of hadith. 

The encyclopedic commentaries of Maliki scholars on the Qur'an and hadith are also important: *al-Jami' li-Ahkam al-Qur'an* by al-Qurtubi, *al-Tamhid* and *al-Istidhkar* by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr, and *al-Muntaqa* by al-Baji, which is the best commentary on the *Muwatta'* for fiqh and istinbat. *Al-Mu'lim* by al-Maziri should be consulted as brilliant and concise commentary on *Sahih Muslim*, while *Sharh al-Zarqani* can be used as a quick reference for the relied-upon opinions of each madhhab. To gain perspective on the reasonings behind the furu'i furuq in ahkam, read *al-Furuq* by al-Qarafi.

## Hanafi Madhhab

Imam Ahmad’s first teacher was Qadi Abu Yusuf, under whom he began seeking fiqh and hadith and he is known to have read the works of Muhammad b. al-Hasan. Read *Al-Asl* by Muhammad b. Hasan al-Shaybani. This is arguably the most important work in the history of fiqh due to the impact it had on those who came after the author. Then read *Sharh Mukhtasar al-Tahawi* by al-Jassas and *Sharh Mukhtasar al-Karkhi* by al-Quduri, both of which contain beneficial furu'i fawa'id. Reference *Bada’i al-Sana’i* by al-Kasani for fiqh al-khilaf, alongwith al-Tahawi's *Sharh Ma'ani al-Athar* and *Sharh Mushkil al-Athar* for commentary on hadith. 

## Contemporary Works

For matters concerning purification, use *Ahkam al-Taharah* by al-Dubyan for research, and concerning zakat, use *Fiqh al-Zakat* by Yusuf al-Qaradawi. For finance, al-Dubyan has composed an encyclopedic work, *al-Mu'amalat al-Maliyah*, and 'Ali al-Qaradaghi has written *Haqibat Talib al-'Ilm*. Both of these should be used for research on matters in this topic.
