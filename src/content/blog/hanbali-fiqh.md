Muwaffaq al-Din Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (620 AH) wrote in the introduction to *al-Mughni*:

> Allah appointed amongst the predecessors of this Ummah, imams from the luminaries. He paved through them the principles of Islam, and He clarified through them difficult rulings. Their agreement is clear-cut proof, and their disagreement is a vast mercy. Hearts are revived by hearing about their lives and happiness is attained by following in their footsteps.
>
> Thereafter, He specified a handful from amongst them according to their position and rank, in knowledge and piety, and preserved their mention and their schools of thought. Rulings revolve around their statements and the jurists of Islam refer to their schools to issue verdicts.
> 
> Our Imam, Abu Abdallah Ahmad b. Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, is from the highest of them in virtue, the closest in his connection to Allah, the most emulous of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and most knowledgeable of his Sunnah, the most minimal in indulging in the Dunya, and the most dedicated to voluntary worship of his Lord. For this reason, we have chosen his school.


# Elementary Level
- *Al-Aqwal Al-Mardiyyah* by Muhammad b. Sabu’ al-Dhahabi

This is the best introduction to the madhhab; it covers the sections of ‘ibadah based upon the madhhab’s relied-upon opinions, mentions basic evidence for each issue, and avoids the terse language found in other primers. 

- *‘Umdat al-Talib* by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti

It should be accompanied with its commentary Hidayat al-Raghib by Ibn Qa’id al-Najdi, which mentions qawa’id, conditions, exceptions, and reasoning of the masa’il. These are the most important things to learn for a student before moving onto the intermediate level. 

- *Dalil al-Talib li-Nayl al-Marib* by Mar’i b. Yusuf al-Karmi

This text is widely taught throughout the Arabian Peninsula and was often memorized in the past. It is very clear and contains more detail than books of a similar size. Listen to the recordings of Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid, which are indispensable for clarifying the positions of the madhab. 

The most important commentaries are that of ‘Abdullah al-Maqdisi and Ibn ‘Iwad, which is titled *Fath Wahhab al-Ma'arib*. hese two books encompass all other works written on Dalil al-Talib. Although they overlap to a certain extent, Ibn ‘Iwad tends to focus on explaining the text itself, while al-Maqdisi often mentions khilaf and tangential, yet beneficial points. For revision of the material, use *al-Ifsah* by Ibn al-Jarrah and *al-As'ilat wa'l-Ajwibah* by 'Abd al-Wahhab al-Faris.

- *Mukhtasar al-Tahrir* by Ibn al-Najjar al-Futuhi

Listen to the recordings of Hasan Bukhari, who is widely read in usul al-fiqh, has a deep grasp of the underlying reason for differences, and has a unique talent in explaining texts. For more detail at this level, reference *al-Dhukhr al-Harir* by Ahmad b. ‘Abdullah al-Ba’li

- *Raf’ al-Malam* by Taqi al-Din b. Taymiyyah

This book provides a solid foundation for the asbab of khilaf. It should be accompanied with the commentary of Yusuf al-Ghafis, which provides invaluable advice on dealing with khilaf and how to approach one’s studies. 

# Intermediate Level
- *Al-Rawd Al-Murbi’* by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti

This book is a brilliant commentary on Zad al-Mustaqni’ by Musa al-Hajjawi. Zad al-Mustaqni’ was itself abridged from al-Muqni’ by Ibn Qudamah, which was written to introduce differences of opinion within the madhab. Al-Hajjawi restricted it to the madhhab’s official positions, removing rarely occurring issues and adding some of the more common ones. Whereas Zad al-Mustaqni’ is terse on its In contrast to Dalil al-Talib, which was widely studied in Sham, Zad al-Mustaqni’ became the main text studied among Hanbalis in the Arabian Peninsula. 

There is a large amount of masa’il in this book, and it requires a long amount of time to explain correctly. Due to the status of the original author, the abridger, and the commentator, Al-Rawd Al-Murbi’ has become an extremely important work for the madhhab and relied upon for both teaching and delivering legal rulings. Listen to the recorded lessons of Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid and read his published edition of the book titled Jam al-Rahiq al-Musbi’.

- *Al-Bulbul* by Najm al-Din al-Tufi

This book must be read with its commentary Sharh Mukhtasar al-Rawdah, which is widely regarded as one of the best works in usul al-fiqh ever written. It is the author’s commentary on his abridgement of Ibn Qudamah’s Rawdat al-Nadhir, itself based on al-Mustasfa by al-Ghazali. Ibn Qudamah’s Rawdat al-Nadhir should not be studied independently as it was likely his personal draft of notes from al-Mustasfa. Al-Tufi has a unique, accessible style, and consistently shows humility in his writing. While reading, reference al-Mustasfa, listen to the recorded lessons of Hasan Bukhari and for revision, use Taysir Fahm Rawdat al-Nadhir by Majid al-’Askari, which presents the content in question-answer format. 

- *Sifat al-Mufti* by Ibn Hamdan al-Harrani

After reading this book, begin reading through *Fatawa Ibn Aqil* to see what ifta’ looks like in practice. 

- *Muqaddimat al-Insaf* by ‘Ala al-Din al-Mardawi

This introduction will explain the overall framework used muta’akhirin to determine the madhab’s positions. 

- *Zad al-Musafir* by Ghulam al-Khallal

In this book, the author summarized the narrations of Imam Ahmad from al-Jami’ by Abu Bakr al-Khallal. Al-Khallal can be considered the founder of the madhab due to his efforts in collecting Ahmad’s opinions from his students and performing tarjih between them. Reading Zad al-Musafir will introduce one to the direct statements of the imam, and how the madhab’s opinions developed from them. Make sure to read the surviving sections of al-Jami’ as well, where al-Khallal often makes tarjih or adds explanatory statements to the nusus of the imam. 

- *Tahdhib al-Ajwibah* by Ibn Hamid al-Warraq

This indispensable work must be read in order to understand how the ashab interpreted the nusus of Imam Ahmad along with the terminology that frequently come up in his fatawa. 

- *Al-’Umdah by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi* 

Ibn Qudamah originally authored this book as a primer in his curriculum, consisting of his ikhtiyarat from opinions within the madhhab. However at this stage, it should be read with Sharh al-’Umdah by Ibn Taymiyyah. This commentary only covers the sections of ‘ibadah, yet it remains one of the most comprehensive works on adillah in the madhab. Ibn Taymiyyah makes it a point to mention all of the recorded positions within the madhab, along with explaining whether a position is from the riwayat, wujuh, or aqwal from the students of Ahmad. Complete this with the recorded lessons of Yusuf al-Ghafis on al-’Umdah, where he focuses on fiqh al-khilaf and its asbab. For contemporary issues, listen to the recordings of Hatem al-Haj and read his published commentary. 

# Advanced Level
- *Muntaha al-Iradat* by Ibn al-Najjar al-Futuhi

In this book, the author combined al-Muqni’ with al-Tanqih al-Mushbi’ to produce a summary of the madhab’s relied-upon opinions. It must be accompanied by its commentary Daqa’iq Uli al-Nuha by al-Buhuti, which is one of the most authoritative books in the madhhab. One should also consult Hashiyat Ibn Qa’id. 

- *Al-Iqna’* by Musa b. Ahmad al-Hajjawi

It must be read with its commentary Kashaf al-Qina’ by al-Buhuti. This book, along with Daqa’iq Uli al-Nuha, are the reference points for finding the madhab’s relied-upon opinion. When they disagree, the latter is usually given precedence since it was written later, and if one of these two texts is unclear on an issue, the other is used to explain it. One should also reference Hashiyat al-Khalwati. 

- *Al-Kafi* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi

In this book, the author focuses on presenting the ta’til of the madhhab’s positions, in contrast to al-Muqni’ which mentions several opinions without giving tarjih. The objective of this text is to prepare the reader for ijtihad within the madhab. 

- *Al-Mufradat* by ‘Ali b. ‘Ubaydullah al-Zaghuni

This work is the one of the most extensive books in the madhhab for elaborating on its unique positions. Supplement this with *Al-Minha Al-Shafiyyah* by al-Buhuti, his commentary of Ibn ‘Abd al-Qawi’s poem on Hanbali mufradat. 

- *Jam’ al-Jawami’* by Taj al-Din al-Subki

Listen to the recorded lessons of Hasan Bukhari and read his published edition with Amir Bahjat titled al-Haqibah al-Ta'limiyyah. This book should also be accompanied with its commentary Tashnif al-Masami’ by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi. He was a talented compiler, knowing how to sift through opinions and engage with the tradition.

- *Dawabit Sarf al-Amr wa’l-Nahy* by Khalid al-Otaybi

This book will explain which qara’in to take into consideration for sarf of amr and nahy to wujub and tahrim. This is one of most important topics in usul al-fiqh, but is never addressed in the books of usul, fiqh, or hadith. 

- *Dar al-Qawl al-Qabih* by Najm al-Din al-Tufi

This work is important for understanding the relationship between ‘aqidah and issues in usul al-fiqh. It should be supplemented with *al-Masa’il al-Mushtarikah* by Muhammad al-’Arusi.

- *‘Iqd al-Mandhum* by Shihab al-Din al-Qarafi

This text deals with all the asbab of ‘umum.

- *Al-Tahbir* by ‘Ala al-Din al-Mardawi

- *Al-Bahr Al-Muhit* by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi

Similar to al-Tahbir, this book is an encyclopedia and the last truly great work written on usul al-fiqh. Nothing after comes close to its scope and depth. Also read al-Zarkashi’s Salasil al-Dhahab, which presents issues not typically found in books of usul al-fiqh.

- *Al-Qawa’id* by ‘Ala al-Din Ibn al-Lahham

At this juncture, one should begin the study of takhrij al-furu’ ‘ala al-usul, which demonstrates how usul al-fiqh is practically applied to furu’. Ibn al-Lahham mentions al-qawa’id al-usuliyyah and demonstrates how furu’ are built upon them. Supplement this with Takhrij al-Furu’ ‘ala al-Usul by Uthman Shushan. Shushan relies on many different sources and brings examples from Ibn Qudamah’s al-Mughni, making it one of the most comprehensive works on the subject. 

- *Idah al-Dala’il* by Sharaf al-Din al-Zarirani

One should commence the study of furuq with this work by al-Zarirani, the shaykh of al-Tufi and al-Dujayli. This book will serve as an excellent tool for understanding ta’lil and furuq.

- *Taqrir al-Qawa’id* by Zayn al-Din Ibn Rajab

# Mastery 
- *Al-Muqni’* by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi

One should aim for mastery, which entails being able to independently arrive at the same conclusions the imams of the madhab have reached. Read the following commentaries simultaneously: 

- *Al-Mutli’* by Shams al-Din b. Abi al-Fath
- *Al-Mumti’* by Abu’l-Barkat b. al-Munajja
- *Al-Shafi* by Shams al-Din b. Abi ‘Umar: Better known as al-Sharh al-Kabir, this book was written by Ibn Abi ‘Umar as a rearrangement of al-Mughni, authored by his uncle Ibn Qudamah, based on the organization of al-Muqni’. The original work is considered one of the most comprehensive books in fiqh ever written, allowing one to observe every aspect of using, debating, defending, and deconstructing qiyas. 
- *Al-Mubdi’* by Burhan al-Din b. Muflih
- *Al-Insaf* by ‘Ala al-Din al-Mardawi: Al-Insaf is the encyclopedia of internal Hanbali differences, with the relied-upojn view being highlighted. Imam al-Mardawi marks the final stage of development for the madhab and he is referred to as al-Murajjih, al-Musahhih, and al-Munaqqih depending where he is quoted from. 

*Al-Mumti’* largely focuses on istidlal and niqash, *al-Insaf* on naql of the madhab, *al-Shafi* on adillah, while *al-Mubdi’* strikes a balance between istidlal and naql. Both al-Insaf and al-Shafi were influential on later scholars for istidlal of the madhab. Together, these books provide a balance between studying khilaf ‘ali, which widens ones perspective, and khilaf nazil, which deepens one’s understanding of each far’ and the subtitles of ta’lil. It is impossible, with some semblance of objectivity, to delve into works of istidlalat and khilaf 'ali and come out still holding to all of the madhab’s relied-upon positions. However, doing this will increase one’s respect for the genius of the madhab’s imams and their overall approach.

Imam Ahmad lauded al-Shafi’i for canonizing the framework ahl al-hadith employed to extract rulings from the nusus and often recommended studying his works. Read *al-Umm* by Imam al-Shafi’i and *Nihayat al-Matlab* by al-Juwayni. Nihayat al-Matlab is one of the greatest works in fiqh ever written, where the author clearly explains the ta’lilat and shows how the furu’ of a bab tie back to the ta’lil of its usul. Al-Shafi'i similarly begins each chapter with evidence and branches out from there. His reasoning is of higher quality and more transparent than what later texts within the Shafi’i madhab provide. Also read al-Awsat by Ibn al-Mundhir, who was an independent jurist in his own right and relied upon by Ibn Qudamah for al-Mughni. 

Imam Ahmad often redirected questioners towards the circles of the Malikis, Abu’l-Khattab held that ‘Amal Ahl al-Madinah is to be used for giving tarjih, and Ibn Taymiyyah personally held that the Malikis were the most correct in usul. Before commencing with the Maliki madhab, read *Tasmiyat wa’l-Hikayat* by al-Saraqusti. This early book on tabaqat sheds light on how a madhab is built and evolves, politics and issues between scholars, along with how and why certain books become relied upon in the madhab. Then read *al-Mudawwanah* by Shanun and al-Dhakhirah by al-Qarafi. 

Imam Ahmad’s first teacher was Qadi Abu Yusuf, under whom he began seeking fiqh and hadith. Read *al-Asl* and *Kitab al-Hujjah* by Muhammad b. Hasan al-Shaybani. Also read *Bada’i al-Sana’i* by al-Kasani.
