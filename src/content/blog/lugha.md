# Elementary Level
- *Qatr al-Nada* by Ibn Hisham al-Ansari

This must be accompanied by i'rab practice of the Qur'an to apply what one has learned.

- *Musil al-Tullab* by Khalid b. 'Abdullah al-Azhari

- *Al-Kafaf* by al-Saydawi

In this book, the author does an excellent job at simplifying the grammar of classical Arabic.

- *Al-Sarf Al-’Arabi* by Muhammad b. Fadil al-Samarra’i

- *Durus al-Balaghah* by Hifni Nasif

Complement this with *Al-Balaghat al-Wadihah*, which is important for a practical understanding of balaghah.

# Intermediate Level

- *Ma’ani al-Nahw* by Fadil al-Samarra’i

- *Al-Khulasah Al-Alfiyyah* by Abu Abdullah b. Malik

Also known as *Afliyyat Ibn Malik*, this poem is commonly studied in schools throughout the Arab world. All the manahij of studying nahw go back to the Afilyyah, and one should memorize given the time. It must be studied with the well-known commentary of Ibn Aqil.

- *Shudhur al-Dhahab* by Ibn Hisham al-Ansari

- *Mukhtasar al-Ma'ani* by Sa'd al-Din al-Taftazani

This is an important text that will draw the connection between logic and balaghah, as well as opening up advanced texts on balaghah for study.

- *Al-'Umdah* by Ibn Rashiq al-Qayrawani

- *Sharh al-Mu'allaqat Al-Sab'* by al-Husayn b. Ahmad al-Zuzani

Read the critical edition of Muhyi al-Din 'Abd al-Hamid, which also contains his hashiyah. Also become familiar with the other three mu'allaqat. 

Once one has understood the words, the next step is to live through the poet, his words, his life, his asaleeb, his word choice, and his topic choice. Listen to the commentaries of Abu Qays Muhammad Rashid on Zuhayr, Imru'l-Qays, al-Nabighah. He consumed all of the classical commentaries and produced something far above what they offer.

At this point, begin memorizing shi'r. Jahili poetry is used as murajjihat in both tafsir and lughah, where it is known as shawahid. Memorizing and knowing them helps understand the Qur'an and its i'jaz. This is evident if one checks any book of tafsir that has 'inayah with lughah, such as al-Tabari, al-Wahidi, Ibn 'Ashur, and Ibn 'Atiyyah among others. 

Some poetry is memorized and learned for the beautiful meanings they have, even if others are of a higher caliber in the formation of shi'r. Poets like al-Mutanabbi fall under this category. Memorizing poetry also helps develop a pattern of eloquent tarakib and styles. Some say that the best way to achieve eloquence is to memorize an entire anthology and then forget it.

- *Maqamat al-Hariri* by al-Hariri

Maqamat al-Hariri is extremely important for building vocabulary.

Complement this with *Diwan al-Hudhaliyin*, beginning with Abu Dhuwayb. Shaykh Hatim al-'Awni recommends *Mawsu'at al-Shi'r al-Arabi*, which covers select qawa'id from major shu'ara up to the modern era. The first four volumes are on jahili shi'r, consisting of selections from each poet, along with discussions and commentary.

# Advanced Level

- *Ham’ al-Hawami’* by Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti

This work is one of the best books ever written on nahw. He relied heavily on *al-Tadhyil* by Abu Hayyan in this work. Supplement it by reading *al-Muzhil* by the same author, an encycleopedic work that gathers various discussions in an accessible manner such that it can be used as a starting point for futher research and exploation. 

- *Mughni al-Labib* by Ibn Hisham al-Ansari

- *Tashil al-Fawa’id* by Abu Abdullah b. Malik

Studying this book and its commentaries is very beneficial. The most important of these is Abu Hayyan’s al-Tadhyil wa’l-Takmil, as he often disagrees with Ibn Malik. This should be coupled with al-Damamini’s excellent commentary, who was also very independent and made many i’tiradhat on many before him, including Abu Hayyan. When it comes to Ibn Malik, he refines and critiques his opinions, even his choice of words.

- *Al-Kafiyah* by Abu 'Amr b. al-Hajib 

- *Al-Mumti* by Ibn Usfur

- *Al-Mustasqa* by 'Abd al-Latif al-Khatib
