# Elementary Level
Before commencing with the following texts, a basic level of comprehension is required. Study *Navigating the Arabic Text* and *Forming the Arabic Word* by Taha Karaan, or their equivalent. Following this, read through *Qasas al-Nabiyyin* by Abu'l-Hasan Ali al-Nadwi and practice placing tashkil on passages without harakat based on what one has learned. At this point, constant reading is the most important activity to pick up vocabulary and comprehension. A good anthology is *Mukhtarat min Adab al-Arab*, also by Abu'l-Hasan Ali al-Nadwi. Write down and memorize the meaning, form, and root of unfamiliar words using a trusted dictionary.

- *Al-Ajrumiyyah* by Ibn Ajrum

Read it with its commentary *al-Tawdih* by Ali Hani, which includes practice problems from Mustafa Amin's *al-Nahw al-Wadhih*. Sulayman al-Uyuni suggests covering *al-Ajrumiyyah* cover-to-cover multiple times over a short period to get a good tasawwur of the 'ilm as a whole. This can be accomplished by reading Ali Hani's remaining commentaries with increasing detail: *al-Tashil* and *al-Sharh al-Mutawwal*. This must also be accompanied by extensive i'rab of practice with the Qur'an to apply what has been learned. 

Supplement this with *al-Kafaf* by al-Saydawi. The author does an excellent job at simplifying the rules of grammar and presents abundant examples from Qur'an and shi'r to illustrate them. For learning how to traditionally present i'rab, read *Expressing I'rab* by David Jalajel. 

- *Qatr al-Nada* by Ibn Hisham al-Ansari

Read it with the author's commentary and Muhyi al-Din 'Abd al-Hamid's footnotes. This will be the one's first introduction to grammar in a logical and systematic manner. Ibn Hisham's commentary contains complex discussions and introduces differences of opinion between the grammarians. Complement this book by reading *Sharh Shadharat al-Dhahab*, which is also by Ibn Hisham and using *al-Nahw al-Wadhifi* by 'Abd al-Alim Ibrahim for practice. After this, one can move on to the intermediate level.

- *Musil al-Tullab* by Khalid b. 'Abdullah al-Azhari

- *Al-Sarf Al-’Arabi* by Muhammad b. Fadil al-Samarra’i

- *Durus al-Balaghah* by Hifni Nasif

Complement this with *al-Balaghat al-Wadhihah* by Mustafa Amin and 'Ali al-Jarim. It is very well-organized; every lesson begins with examples from which the principle being presented is deduced, followed by practice exercises. Use the Hasan al-Samahi's edition, which is split into bayan, badi', and ma'ani. Another excellent introductory work to read is *al-Balaghah: Fununuha wa-Afnanuha* by Fadl Hasan Abbas, which provides a comprehensive overview of the subject and its discussions.

# Intermediate Level

- *Al-Khulasah Al-Alfiyyah* by Abu Abdullah b. Malik

Also known as *Afliyyat Ibn Malik*, this poem is commonly studied in schools throughout the Arab world. All the manahij of studying nahw go back to the Afilyyah, and one should memorize it given the time. It must be studied with the well-known commentary of Ibn Aqil, then follow it up by reading the commentary of al-Ushmuni. Complement this by reading *Ma’ani al-Nahw* by Fadil al-Samarra’i

- *Tasrif al-'Izzi* by 'Abd al-Wahhab al-Zajani

Read it with al-Taftazani's well-known commentary. Complement this with *Taysir al-I'lal wa'l-Ibdal* by 'Abd al-'Alim Ibrahim.

- *Al-Minhaj Al-Wadih* by Hamid 'Awni

This book is an excellent stepping stone between introductory books on balaghah and more advanced texts. Listen to the recordings of 'Ali Hani on this text.

- *Mukhtasar al-Ma'ani* by Sa'd al-Din al-Taftazani

This is an important text that will draw the connection between logic and balaghah, as well as opening up advanced texts on balaghah for study. Complement this with 'Abddurahman Habannaka's two-volume *al-Balaghah al-'Arabiyyah*.

- *Al-'Umdah* by Ibn Rashiq al-Qayrawani

- *Sharh al-Mu'allaqat Al-Sab'* by al-Husayn b. Ahmad al-Zuzani

Read the critical edition of Muhyi al-Din 'Abd al-Hamid, which also contains his hashiyah, and become familiar with the other three mu'allaqat. Complement this with *Dawanin al-Shu'ara' al-Sittah* with commentary by Atah al-Yadali and Muhammad al-Khadim. This diwan consists of 2000 abyat, a good choice to do hifdh of.

Once one has understood the words, the next step is to live through the poet, his words, his life, his asaleeb, his word choice, and his topic choice. Listen to the recordings of Abu Qays Muhammad Rashid on Zuhayr, Imru'l-Qays, al-Nabighah; he consumed all of the classical commentaries and produced something far above what they offer.

At this point, begin memorizing shi'r. Jahili poetry is used as murajjihat in both tafsir and lughah, where it is known as shawahid. Memorizing and knowing them helps understand the Qur'an and its i'jaz. This is evident if one checks any book of tafsir that has 'inayah with lughah, such as al-Tabari, al-Wahidi, Ibn 'Ashur, and Ibn 'Atiyyah among others. 

Some poetry is memorized and learned for the beautiful meanings they have, even if others are of a higher caliber in the formation of shi'r. Poets like al-Mutanabbi fall under this category. Memorizing poetry also helps develop a pattern of eloquent tarakib and styles. Some say that the best way to achieve eloquence is to memorize an entire anthology and then forget it.

- *Maqamat al-Hariri* by al-Hariri

Maqamat al-Hariri is extremely important for building vocabulary. Complement this with *Diwan al-Hudhaliyin*, beginning with Abu Dhuwayb. Shaykh Hatim al-'Awni recommends *Mawsu'at al-Shi'r al-Arabi*, which covers select qawa'id from major shu'ara up to the modern era. The first four volumes are on jahili shi'r, consisting of selections from each poet, along with discussions and commentary.

# Advanced Level

- *Tashil al-Fawa’id* by Abu Abdullah b. Malik

Studying this book and its commentaries is very beneficial. Read Ibn Aqil's *Al-Musa'id* first, then move on to Hayyan’s *al-Tadhyil wa’l-Takmil*, where he often disagrees with Ibn Malik, and al-Damamini’s excellent commentary. Al-Damamini was also very independent and made many i’tiradhat on grammarians before him, including Abu Hayyan and Ibn Malik. 

- *Mughni al-Labib* by Ibn Hisham al-Ansari

- *Ham’ al-Hawami’* by Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti

This work is one of the best books ever written on nahw. He relied heavily on *al-Tadhyil* by Abu Hayyan in this work. Supplement it by reading *al-Muzhil* by the same author, an encycleopedic work that gathers various discussions in an accessible manner such that it can be used as a starting point for further research and exploration. 

- *Al-Kafiyah* by Abu 'Amr b. al-Hajib
