# Elementary Level
- *Al-Miftah* by Adham al-Asimi

This text was authored as a short primer that avoids introducing superfluous topics to the beginner. Al-Asimi also does a good job of explaining concepts in easy terminology. He has a recorded commentary on the book which should be listened to, where he caters towards explaining concepts in easy-to-understand language for the audience.

Follow this up with the lessons of ‘Abd al-Hamid al-Turkmani titled Durus al-Mantiq. He remains one of the foremost experts in logic, philosophy, and kalam in our time.

# Intermediate Level 
- *Al-Isaghuji* by Athir al-Din al-Abhari

This text will be the student’s first introduction to a classical text on mantiq. It should be accompanied by its commentary, Mughni al-Tullab by al-Maghnisi. Listen to the recorded lessons of Adham al-Asimi, who has a talent for explaining advanced topics in simple terms. 

# Advanced Level 
- *Al-Mirqat* by Fadl al-Haqq al-Khayrabadi

This text is greater than al-Isaghuji in terms of material and is much more organized. Listen to the lessons of ‘Abd al-Hamid al-Turkmani.

At this point, one should begin studying discrete mathematics, especially set theory and propositional logic. It allows one to relate between mathematical realities and see their relationship with syllogistic arguments. The accuracy of logic is predicated on the accuracy of mathematics, and many scholars have stated that one cannot become a component faqih without understanding mathematical realities. 

- *Dawabit al-Ma’rifah* by ‘Abdurrahman b. Hasan al-Maydani

This book is the culmination of one’s studies in mantiq and will tie together many of the topics already covered. After this, the deeper works on mantiq will be something one is aware of, so each person can choose to read or listen to whatever suits his needs depending on his field of study.

# Mastery 
- *Al-Shamsiyyah* by Najm al-Din al-Katibi

Listen to the recorded commentary of ‘Abd al-Hamid al-Turkmani.
