# Elementary Level
At this stage, one should set a dedicated time to study each week, sticking to a routine and remaining consistent. A manageable amount is to read half a juz' a week, or the tafsir of a page from the mushaf each day. This way, one will have completed a full tafsir of the Qur'an in a year. Studying nahw with the intention of mastering i'rab as early as possible is important at this level. 

- *Al-Tahrir* by Musa'id al-Tayyar

- *Al-Muharrar* by Musa'id al-Tayyar

- *Al-Muqaddimat Al-Asassiyah* by ‘Abdullah al-Juday’

At this point, listen to Ali Hani’s series *Al-Tariqat Al-Muthla*, which is a brief introduction on how tafsir is performed. Also read *Akhlaq Hamalat al-Qur'an* by Abu Bakr al-Ajurri, a short book and one of the earliest sources to gather to required manners and characters bearers of the Qur'an.

- *Madarik al-Tanzil* by Abu'l-Barakat al-Nasafi

Shaykh Ali Hani recommends this work for beginners. It surpasses other introductory tafasir in both clarity and ease of expression, without sacrificing technical accuracy. This book is from a classical scholar, yet accessible to contemporary readers. Al-Nasafi offers a digestible summary of al-Zamakhshari and al-Baydawi, who can be cryptic and hard to understand. Begin reading it as soon as one has gained a basic understanding of grammar and morphology. Watch the recordings of 'Ali Hani on this tafsir.

- *Tashil al-'Ulum al-Tanzil* by Ibn Juzayy al-Kalbi

Another excellent choice for this level is *Tafsir Ibn Juzayy*, which largely relies on *al-Muharrar al-Wajiz* by Ibn 'Attiyah and *al-Kashshaf* by al-Zamakhshari. Ibn Juzayy was an excellent writer and his tafsir is preferred in North and West Africa. He does not comment on everything, so a teacher must fill in the gaps. Ensure the edition you are reading uses the qira'ah of Nafi', which is what the author based this work on. His muqaddimat are also important; Musa'id al-Tayyar has a commentary on them which should also be read. 

- *Al-Muqaddimat Al-Jazariyyah* by Ibn al-Jazari

Before studying this poem, listen to Musa Abu Zaghleh's recorded series on tajwid. It should be read with its commentary by Ghanim Quduri al-Hamad, which consolidates over a dozen classical and contemporary works on the *Jazariyyah*. Keep in mind that tajwid can only be mastered through continuous practice, listening, and correction. 

- *Al-Muyassar fi-'Ilm 'Add Ayy al-Qur'an* by Ahmad Khalid Shukri

Most ayah endings are obvious but a degree of ambiguity arises in certain places, leading to khilaf. These issues are dealt with in ‘ilm ’add al-ayi, for which Sh. Ali Hani highly recommends studying this work by Ahmad Shukri. 

- *Al-Muyassar fi-'Ilm Rasm al-Mushaf* by by Ghanim Qadduri al-Hamad

- *Tarikh al-Qur’an* by ‘Abd al-Sabur Shahin

# Intermediate Level
The objective at this stage is to familiarize oneself with multiple aspects of tafsir, especially concerning the explanation of words and the various narrations regarding each ayah, without striving to find which is the strongest nor being too concerned when different statements are attributed the same authorities, such as Ibn ‘Abbas. 

At this stage, one begins to move from having a general understanding of each ayah to applying usul al-tafsir, which includes causes of different opinions, categories of interpretation, principles of interpretation, rules of giving tarjih, knowing the nomenclature of the mufassirin, various qira’at, causes of revelation, and abrogation. The Qur'an cannot be studied up to a certain point without also studying qira'at and tajwid in detail. Qira'at in particular have a heavy role in tafsir, though they do not need to necessarily be memorized. However, if someone wants to master qira'at, he should study works on qira'at, rasm, and 'add, then find a good muqri' to read to.

- *Al-Tahsil* by Abu’l-Abbas al-Mahdawi

This work places tafsir, abrogation, i’rab, ahkam, and qira’at into well-organized sections. 

For an overview of the meanings of specific words in the Qur’an, reference *Kulliyat al-Alfadh* by al-Qarni and *Gharib al-Quran* by Ibn Qutaybah, which is a highly influential work that was quoted by many of the classical mufassirin including al-Tabari, al-Qurtubi, and al-Razi. It is relatively brief and the best place to begin looking for the meaning of ambiguous words. 

- *Zad al-Masir* by Ibn al-Jawzi

This is also an ideal intermediate tafsir which concisely presents various opinions without giving tarjih. It was written to give basic tools to the student before going in depth. The text is both comprehensive and concise. While studying this book, begin to memorize the various positions of the early mufassirin.

- *Al-Burhan* by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi

- *Al-Isharat Al-Ilahiyyah* by Najm al-Din al-Tufi

In this work, the author comments on ayat relevant to aqa’id and usul. This work is frequently quoted in later books of Hanbali usul, and is important for understanding how to recognize ‘umum and khusus in the Qur’an. 

- *Ahkam al-Qur’an* by Abu Bakr b. al-’Arabi

Out of all of those who authored a book on the topic of rulings in the Qur’an, Ibn ‘Arabi had the most mastery of the various ulum.

- *Majaz al-Qur’an* by Izz al-Din b. ‘Abd al-Salam

To get familiar with the usage of majaz in the Qur’an, study this work and reference *Asas al-Balaghah* of al-Zamakhshari, where he brings examples of majaz for each root and explains them as well. To understand the claim of those who reject the haqiqah-majaz taqsim as useful, listen to *Majaz ‘inda Ibn Taymiyyah* by Muhammad Yunus ‘Ali, who is one of the most foremost linguists to explain this issue. 

- *Hirz al-Ma'ani* by Abu'l-Qasim al-Shatibi

Well-known as *al-Shatibiyyah*, this poem presents the usul of the seven major qira'at. Memorize it given the time and read its commentaries: *Fath al-Wasid* by Abu'l-Hasan al-Sakhawi, one of al-Shatibi's most distinguished students, and *Ibraz al-Ma'ani* by Abu Shamah. 

- *Husn al-Madad* by Burhan al-Din al-Ja'bari

- *Al-Muqni'* by Abu 'Amr al-Dani

This is an important classical work on the rasm and differences between the masahif.

- *Al-Masahif* by Ibn Abi Dawud

At this point, this book is crucial to read because it contains important information about the early history of the Qur'an, including problematic reports that need further explanation. Listening to Musa’id al-Tayyar’s *Tarikh al Qur'an* recordings before reading *al-Masahif* will give you a framework to analyze and interpret those narrations. Next, read *Fada'il al-Qur'an* by Abu 'Ubayd al-Qasim, who is one of the most important scholars of the Qur'an in history. His khidmah to the Qur'an has makes him a key link for much of what is known about it today.

# Advanced Level
At this stage one begins to address the issue of tarjih and knowing which view is most correct about what is said about each ayah, as well as the strongest non-preponderant views, as these have the possibility of also being correct. 

- *Al-Muharrar Al-Wajiz* by Abu Muhammad b. 'Attiyah

Ibn 'Attiyah’s tafsir pays great attention to establishing tarjih from the sayings of the Salaf, and also trains one for tarjih between different opinions. It was highly regarded by Ibn Khaldun and Ibn Taymiyyah due to its extensive and meticulous research, summarizing the formative tradition with the most accurate narrations, and was influential on later mufassirin such as al-Qurtubi, Abu Hayyan, and Ibn Kathir.

- *Jami’ al-Bayan* by Abu Ja’far al-Tabari

All knowledge of tafsir has its foundation in the tafsir of al-Tabari. It shows one how to reconcile variant opinions of the mufassirin, compare with other ayat, and deduce rulings, all in order to establish the correct meaning of the ayah. 

- *Al-Kashshaf* by al-Zamakhshari

The author of this tafsir, a notable Mu’tazili, set the foundation for all linguistic tafsir after him. It should be read with Futuh al-Ghuyub, al-Tibi’s highly regarded commentary. 

- *Al-Nashr fi'l-Qira'at al-'Ashr* by Ibn al-Jazari

- *Al-Ibanah ‘an Ma’ani al-Qira’at* by Ibn Abi Talib al-Makki

This book is concerned with the history of ahruf and qira'at. It is one of the most important works to read in order to understand the topic. Supplement this by reading *Ma’ani al-Ahruf al-Sab’ah* by ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Razi and *Al-Murshid Al-Wajiz* by Abu Shamah to gain a comprehensive view of the various opinions. Also read the sections relevant to the seven ahruf from *Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar*, *Sharh Mushkil al-Athar* by al-Tahawi, *al-Tamhid* by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr. *Masa'il al-Qira'at* by al-Qijati is another important work to read.

- *Al-Tabsirah* by Ibn Abi Talib al-Makki

This text was written by Ibn Abi Talib on the seven qira’at themselves. The author wrote al-Ibanah as an introduction to this book, and later goes on to explain the differences between the qira’at in al-Kashf. Supplement it with *al-Qira’at* by Abu ‘Ubayd al-Qasim. It is also important to learn the various dialects of the Arabs; especially those of Quraysh, Hudhayl, and Najd. This can be accomplished by studying works like *Laughat Quraysh* by Mukhtar al-Ghawth and significant reading in books of nahw. 

- *Kashf ‘an Wujuh al-Qira’at* by Ibn Abi Talib al-Makki

In this book, Ibn Abi Talib gives his own ikhtiyar between the readings of the seven on every issue. This will give one a glimpse into the process of ikhtiyar and the reasoning involved in it. Abu Ubayd and Abu Hatim both wrote important early works on qira'at which Makki had access to, and he frequently cites their ikhtiyar in *Kashf*. He also quotes from the lost works of al-Tabari and Qadi Isma'il. Supplement this with *Qawa’id al-Tarjih wa’l-Ikhtiyar* by Yahya Jalal, in which he identifies Ibn Abi Talib’s qawa’id for ikhtiyar, along with *Sharh al-Hidayah* by al-Mahdawi and *Al-Badi’* by Ibn Matrif al-Kinani, which are also excellent works on tawjih. 

# Mastery

- *Ruh al-Ma’ani* by Mahmud al-Alusi

This work is the culmination of Ottoman scholarship on balagha. His tafsir is primarily based on Irshad al-’Aql al-Salim by Abu al-Sa’ud, which was itself drawn from the commentaries of Al-Kashshaf by al-Zamkhshari and Anwar al-Tanzil by al-Baydawi. Al-Alusi builds on Abu al-Sa’ud’s work, making it the backbone of his tafsir and similar to what Abu al-Sa’ud did before him, he synthesizes all the commentaries on al-Zamakhshari and al-Baydawi written up until his time. 

- *Al-Basit* by Abu'l-Hasan al-Wahidi

- *Miftah al-Ghayb* by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi

- *Al-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir* by Ibn ‘Ashur

This work is by far the greatest tafsir written in the modern period. Unlike many 20th century mufassirin, Ibn ‘Ashur was firmly grounded in the classical tradition, hailing from a scholarly aristocratic family of judges. The distinguishing feature of his work is his identification of ta’lil and underlining the maqasid of ayat. He also highlights rhetorical devices and reconciles different opinions. It was published between 1956 and 1970 and was the fruit of a lifetime of scholarship of the highest order.

He listed the following eight objectives for his tafsir:

- Reforming Islamic education
- Explaining correct beliefs
- Defining Quranic law
- Clarifying the policy of the Islamic community
- Analyzing the history of ancient punished community
- Demonstrating sound Quranic methods of proof and deduction
