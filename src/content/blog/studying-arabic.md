<center><b>Qatr al-Nada</b>
by Ibn Hisham al-Ansari</center>

Supplement this with Al-Kafaf by al-Saydawi, which concisely summarizes the grammar of classical Arabic.

<center><b>Al-Khulasah Al-Alfiyyah</b>
by Abu Abdullah b. Malik</center>

Better known as Afliyyat Ibn Malik, this poem is widely studied throughout Arabic-speaking countries. All the manahij of studying nahw go back to the Afilyyah, and one should memorize it if there is time. It must be studied with the famous commentary of Ibn Aqil.

Read Sharh Shudhur al-Dhahab by Ibn Hisham al-Ansari.

A useful contemporary textbook at this level is Ma’ani al-Nahw by al-Samarri.

<center><b>Tashil al-Fawa’id</b>
by Abu Abdullah b. Malik</center>

Studying Ibn Malik’s Tashil al-Fawa’id and its commentaries is very beneficial. The most important of these is Abu Hayyan’s al-Tadhyil wa’l-Takmil, as he often disagrees with Ibn Malik. This should be coupled with al-Damamini’s excellent commentary, who was also very independent and made many i’tiradhat on many before him, including Abu Hayyan. When it comes to Ibn Malik, he refines and critiques his opinions, even his choice of words.

Read Mughni al-Labib by Ibn Hisham.

Supplement this with Ham’ al-Hawami’ by Al-Suyuti, which is one of the best books ever written on the subject. He relied heavily on Al-Tadhyil by Abu Hayyan in this work.

<center><b>Al-Kitab</b>
by Amr b. Uthman Sibawayh</center>

Read Sharh al-Mufassal by Ibn Ya’ish, his commentary on al-Zamakhshari’s original work.
