Muwaffaq al-Din b. Qudamah (620 AH) wrote in the introduction to **al-Mughni**:

> Allah appointed amongst the predecessors of this Ummah, imams from the luminaries. He paved through them the principles of Islam, and He clarified through them difficult rulings. Their agreement is clear-cut proof, and their disagreement is a vast mercy. Hearts are revived by hearing about their lives and happiness is attained by following in their footsteps.
>
> Thereafter, He specified a handful from amongst them according to their position and rank, in knowledge and piety, and preserved their mention and their schools of thought. Rulings revolve around their statements and the jurists of Islam refer to their schools to issue verdicts.
>
> Our Imam, Abu Abdallah Ahmad b. Hanbal, may Allah be pleased with him, is from the highest of them in virtue, the closest in his connection to Allah, the most emulous of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and most knowledgeable of his Sunnah, the most minimal in indulging in the Dunya, and the most dedicated to voluntary worship of his Lord. For this reason, we have chosen his school.

The following curriculum is based on the assumption that one has studied the basics through works such as **Bidayat al-῾Abid**, **Kafi al-Mubtadi**, **῾Umdat al-Talib**, **Akhsar al-Mukhtasarat**, or **Al-Aqwal Al-Mardiyyah**; the last of which mentions hadith for each issue and avoids the cryptic language often found in primers.

<b>Dalil al-Talib li-Nayl al-Marib</b> by Mar’i b. Yusuf al-Karmi (1033 AH)
</center>

This book is widely taught throughout the Arabian Peninsula and was often memorized in Sham. It is very clear and contains more detail than other books of a similar size. Listen to the recordings of **Muhammad ῾Abd al-Wahid**, which are indispensable for clarifying the positions of the madhab.

A beneficial commentary to begin with is **Irshad al-Sahib** by ῾Abd al-Karim al-Namlah. This work breaks the text into individual masa’il and clearly outlines the process of istidlal by explaining the sources of rulings and their connections to other principles. Afterwards, one must read **Fath Wahhab al-Marib** by Ibn ῾Iwad (1140 AH), which encompasses all other commentaries written on Dalil al-Talib. Ibn ῾Iwad brings important details from longer books, along with fine points that cannot be found elsewhere. 

For revision, use **Al-As῾ilat wa’l-Ajwibat** by ῾Abd al-Wahid al-Faris, which presents the masa῾il of ibadah and mu῾amalat in a question-and-answer format.

<b>Al-Rawd Al-Murbi'</b> by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti (1052 AH)
</center>

This book is a brilliant commentary on **Zad al-Mustaqni῾** by Musa al-Hajjawi (968 AH). Zad al-Mustaqni was itself abridged from **al-Muqni'** by Ibn Qudamah (620 AH), which was written to introduce differences of opinion within the madhab. Al-Hajjawi restricted it to what he considered the relied-upon opinions of the madhhab. In contrast to Dalil al-Talib, which was widely studied in Sham, Zad al-Mustaqni' became the main text studied among Hanbalis in the Gulf. 

Due to the status of the original author, the abridger, and the commentator, **al-Rawd al-Murbi** has become an extremely important work within madhhab, relied upon for both teaching and delivering legal rulings. Listen to the lessons of **Muhammad ῾Abd al-Wahid** and **Yusuf al-Ghafis** on the chapters they cover and also read **Jam῾ al-Rahiq al-Mushbi῾** also by Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahid, which beautifully elaborates on the text. 


For major ishkalat, begin referencing the equivalent passage in the commentaries of **al-Muqni῾** including as **al-Mumti῾**, **al-Mubdi῾**, **al-Shafi**, and **al-Insaf**. Doing this will build one’s expertise in fiqh and will provide the foundation for a complete study of **Al-Muqni’** at a later stage. 

Supplement this with **Hidayat al-Raghib** by Ibn Qa’id al-Najdi (1094 AH), his commentary on **‘Umdat al-Talib** by al-Buhuti. Ibn Qa῾id mentions qawa῾id, conditions, exceptions, and reasoning of the masa῾il, which are among the most important things to learn for an intermediate student. This book matches al-Rawd al-Murbi’ to a large extent, on top of being organized and well-presented. Ibn ῾Iwad has an important hashiyah on Hidayat al-Raghib titled **Fath Muli al-Mawahib**.

Read **Muqaddimat al-Insaf** by al-Mardawi (885 AH). This will explain the structure of the madhab and the approach used by the muta’akhirin to determine the madhab’s relied-upon positions.

<b>Daqa῾iq Uli al-Nuha</b> by Mansur b. Yunus al-Buhuti (1052 AH)
</center>

This book is also well-known as **Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat**. It is Mansur al-Buhuti’s commentary on **Muntaha al-Iradat** by Ibn al-Najjar, where he combined **al-Muqni’** with **al-Tanqih** by al-Mardawi to produce a summary of the madhab’s relied-upon positions. 

While studying this, reference **Kashaf al-Qina῾** by al-Buhuti, his commentary on **al-Iqna῾** by al-Hajjawi. Along with Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat, these two books are the usual reference points for finding the madhab’s relied-upon opinions. When they disagree, Sharh al-Muntaha is typically given precedence since it was written later, and if one of the two is unclear on an issue, the other is used to explain it. 

Supplement this with **Al-Kafi** by Faris al-Khazraji, his revision of Ibn Qudamah’s original in line with the madhab’s relied-upon opinions. This book focuses on presenting the ta’tilat of the madhab, in contrast to al-Muqni’, where various positions are presented without explanation.

At this stage, read **Sharh al-῾Umdah** by Ibn Taymiyyah (728 AH). Although incomplete, it remains one of the most comprehensive works on adillah of the madhab. He makes it a point to mention all of the different opinions within the madhab, along with explaining whether a position is from the riwayat, wujuh, or aqwal from the students of Ahmad. 

Begin reading through **Zad al-Musafir** by Ghulam al-Khallal (363 AH), his abridgement of **al-Jami῾** by Abu Bakr al-Khallal (311 AH). Al-Khallal can be considered the founder of the madhab due to his efforts in collecting Ahmad’s opinions from his students and performing tarjih between them. Reading this will introduce one to the direct statements of the imam, and how the madhab’s opinions developed from them. 

For an overview of the madhab’s mufradat and an introduction to fiqh al-khilaf, read **al-Minah al-Shafiyyat** by al-Buhuti, his commentary on Ibn ῾Abd al-Qawi’s (699 AH) poem. 


## <center>Mastery (الإتقان)</center>

<b>Al-Muqni’</b> by Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (620 AH)
</center>

The first step of this level is a study of al-Muqni’ and the family of works based on it. One should aim for mastery, which entails being able to independently arrive at the same conclusions the imams of the madhab have reached. Read the following commentaries simultaneously: 

- **Al-Mutli῾** by Shams al-Din b. Abi al-Fath (709 AH)
- **Al-Mumti῾** by Abu’l-Barkat b. al-Munajja (695 AH)
- **Al-Shafi** by Shams al-Din b. Abi ῾Umar (682 AH)
- **Al-Mubdi῾** by Burhan al-Din b. Muflih (884 AH)
- **Al-Insaf** by ῾Ala al-Din al-Mardawi (885 AH)

**Al-Shafi**, also known as **al-Sharh al-Kabir**, was written by the author as a rearrangement of his uncle Ibn Qudamah’s **al-Mughni** based on the organization of **al-Muqni’**. The original work by Ibn Qudamah is considered one of the most comprehensive books in fiqh ever written, allowing one to observe every aspect of using, debating, defending, and deconstructing aqyisah. 

**Al-Insaf** is the encyclopedia of internal Hanbali differences, with the relied-upon view being highlighted. Imam al-Mardawi marks the final stage of development for the madhab and was given the laqab of al-Murajjih, al-Musahhih, and al-Munaqqih.

Al-Mumti῾ largely focuses on istidlal and niqash, Al-Insaf on naql of the madhab, Al-Shafi on adillah, while Al-Mubdi῾ strikes a balance between istidlal and naql. Al-Insaf and Al-Shafi were influential on later scholars for istidlal of the madhab. Together, these commentaries strike a balance between studying khilaf ῾ali, which widens ones perspective, and khilaf nazil, which deepens one’s understanding of each far’ and the subtitles of ta῾lil. 

It is impossible to delve, with some semblance of objectivity, into works of istidlalat and khilaf ῾ali and come out still holding to all of the madhab’s relied-upon positions. However, doing this will increase one’s respect for the genius of the madhab's imam and overall approach.
