- Abu Bakr al-Marrudhi
    - *Akhbar al-Shuyukh*: 
    - *Kitab al-Wara’*:

- Ibn Abi Dunya

- Abu Isma'il al-Harawi
    - *Manazil al-Sa'irin*: This book is one of the most important works on tasawwuf written by a Hanbali scholar. It should be read with *Madarij al-Salikin* by Ibn al-Qayyim. In this commentary of Manazil al-Sa’irin, he tempers al-Harawi’s tasawwuf, although his corrections can be overbearing at times. Fadil b. al-Hamid al-Zawzani (760 AH) has a concise abridgement of Manazil al-Sa'irin titled *Manazil al-Salikin*.

- ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani
    - *Jila’ al-Khatir*: This book consists of advice taken from the majalis of ‘Abd al-Qadir and compiled by his students. It is similar to Ayyuha ‘l-Walad by al-Ghazali. 
    - *Adab al-Suluk*
    - *Futuh al-Ghayb*

- Ibn al-Jawzi
    - *Sayd al-Khatir*
    - *Talbis Iblis*
    - *Sifat al-Safwah*
    - *Al-Mudhish*
    - *Al-Tabsirah*

- Ibn ‘Abd al-Qawi
    - *Mandhumah al-Adab*: This poem should be accompanied by al-Saffarini’s commentary Ghida’ al-Albab.
    
- Najm al-Din b. Qudamah
    - *Mukhtasar Minhaj al-Qasidin*: This book is an abridgement of Ibn al-Jawzi’s Minhaj al-Qasidin, which is itself a Hanbali recension of al-Ghazali’s Ihya ‘Ulum al-Din. In this abridgement, al-Najm restricted the content to only what is relevant to suluk, in contrast to Minhaj al-Qasidin which often includes details of fiqh as well.

- Ahmad b. Ibrahim al-Wasiti:
    - *Maydan al-Mahabbat wa’l-Irfan*

- Shams al-Din b. al-Qayyim:
    - *Al-Wabil Al-Sayyib*
    - *Al-Da’ wa’l-Dawa’*
    - *Tariq al-Hijratayn*
    - *Ighathat al-Lahfan*
    - *‘Uddat al-Sabirin*
    - *Rawdat al-Muhibbin*
    - *Hadi al-Awrah*
    - *Kitab al-Ruh*
    - *Miftah Dar al-Sa’adah*

- Shams al-Din b. Muflih

    - *Al-Adab Al-Shar’iyyah*: This is Ibn Muflih’s masterpiece on adab, which incorporates wonderful discussions outlining the deficiencies a Muslim may have, along with their respective solutions. This work is irreplaceable because it frequently quotes from lost texts, especially Ibn Aqil’s Al-Funun.

- Zayn al-Din b. Rajab
    - *Lata’if al-Ma’arif*:
    - *Nur al-Iqtibas*:

- Zayn al-Din b. Dawud
