# Elementary Level
- *Al-Tahrir* by Musa'id al-Tayyar

- *Al-Muharrar* by Musa'id al-Tayyar

- *Al-Muqaddimat Al-Asassiyah by ‘Abdullah al-Juday’

At this point, also listen to Ali Hani’s series *Al-Tariqat Al-Muthla*, which is a brief introduction on how to approach studying tafsir. 

- *Safwat al-Tafsir* by Muhammad Ali al-Sabuni

This work focuses on introducing each surah, explaining vocabulary, highlighting subtleties, benefits, placing verses in context in relation to others, presenting the causes of revelation, and rhetorical devices. It is by far the best introductory tafsir ever written. 

# Intermediate Level
The objective at this stage is to familiarize oneself with multiple aspects of tafsir, especially concerning the explanation of words and the various narrations regarding each ayah, without striving to find which is the strongest nor being too concerned when different statements are attributed the same authorities, such as Ibn ‘Abbas. 

At this stage, one begins to move from having a general understanding of each ayah to applying usul al-tafsir, which includes causes of different opinions, categories of interpretation, principles of interpretation, rules of giving tarjih, knowing the nomenclature of the mufassirin, various qira’at, causes of revelation, and abrogation.

- *Al-Tahsil* by Abu’l-Abbas al-Mahdawi

This work places tafsir, abrogation, i’rab, ahkam, and qira’at into well-organized sections. 

- *Zad al-Masir* by Ibn al-Jawzi

This is also an ideal intermediate tafsir which concisely presents various opinions without giving tarjih. It was written to give basic tools to the student before going in depth. The text is both comprehensive and concise. While studying this book, begin to memorize the various positions of the early mufassirin.

- *Tarikh al-Qur’an* by ‘Abd al-Sabur Sahin

- *Al-Isharat Al-Ilahiyyah* by Najm al-Din al-Tufi: In this work, the author comments on ayat relevant to aqa’id and usul. This work is frequently quoted in later books of Hanbali usul, and is important for understanding how to recognize ‘umum and khusus in the Qur’an. 

- *Ahkam al-Qur’an* by Abu Bakr b. al-’Arabi: Out of all of those who authored a book on the topic of rulings in the Qur’an, Ibn ‘Arabi had the most mastery of the various ulum.

- *Majaz al-Qur’an* by Izz al-Din b. ‘Abd al-Salam

To get familiar with the usage of majaz in the Qur’an, study this work and reference Asas al-Balaghah of al-Zamakhshari, where he brings examples of majaz for each root and explains them as well. To understand the claim of those who reject the haqiqah-majaz taqsim as useful, listen to *Majaz ‘inda Ibn Taymiyyah* by Muhammad Yunus ‘Ali, who is one of the most foremost linguists to explain this issue. 

- *Al-Burhan* by Badr al-Din al-Zarkashi

- *Al-Masahif* by Ibn Abi Dawud

At this point, this book is crucial to read because it contains important information about the early history of the Qur'an, including problematic reports that need further explanation. Listening to Musa’id al-Tayyar’s Tarikh al Qur'an recordings before reading Al-Masahif will give you a framework to analyze and interpret those narrations. 

- *Al-Muyassar* by Ahmad Shukri

Most ayah endings are obvious but a degree of ambiguity arises in certain places leading to khilaf. These issues are dealt with in ‘ilm ’add al-ayi, for which Sh. Ali Hani highly recommends this book by Ahmad Shukri. 

For an overview of the meanings of specific words in the Qur’an, read Kulliyat al-Alfadh by al-Qarni. Gharib al-Quran by Ibn Qutaybah is also a highly influential work that is quoted by many of the classical mufassirin such as al-Tabari, al-Qurtubi, and al-Razi. It is relatively brief and the best place to begin looking for the meaning of ambiguous words. 

# Advanced Level
At this stage one begins to address the issue of tarjih and knowing which view is most correct about what is said about each ayah, as well as the strongest non-preponderant views, as these have the possibility of also being correct. 

- *Al-Ibanah ‘an Ma’ani al-Qira’at* by Ibn Abi Talib al-Makki

This book is concerned with the history of ahruf and qira'at and is one of the most important works to read in order to understand the topic. Supplement it with Ma’ani al-Ahruf al-Sab’ah by ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Razi and Al-Murshid Al-Wajiz by Abu Shamah to gain an understanding of different perspectives.

- *Al-Tabsirah* by Ibn Abi Talib al-Makki

This text was written by Ibn Abi Talib on the seven qira’at themselves. The author wrote al-Ibanah as an introduction to this book, and later goes on to explain the differences between the qira’at in al-Kashf. Supplement it with al-Qira’at by Abu ‘Ubayd al-Qasim. It is also important to learn the various dialects of the Arabs; especially those of Quraysh, Hudhayl, and Najd. This can be picked up by significant reading in books of nahw. 

- *Kashf ‘an Wujuh al-Qira’at* by Ibn Abi Talib al-Makki

In this book, Ibn Abi Talib gives his own ikhtiyar between the readings of the seven on every issue. This will give one a glimpse into the process of ikhtiyar and the reasoning involved in it. Supplement this with Qawa’id al-Tarjih wa’l-Ikhtiyar by Yahya Jalal, in which he identifies Ibn Abi Talib’s qawa’id for ikhtiyar. Also read Sharh al-Hidayah by al-Mahdawi and Al-Badi’ by Ibn Matrif al-Kinani. 

- *Al-Muharrar Al-Wajiz* by Abu Muhammad b. Attiyah

Ibn Attiyah’s tafsir pays great attention to establishing tarjih from the sayings of the Salaf, and also trains one for tarjih between different opinions. It was highly regarded by Ibn Khaldun and Ibn Taymiyyah due to its extensive and meticulous research, summarizing the formative tradition with the most accurate narrations, and was influential on later mufassirin such as al-Qurtubi, Abu Hayyan, and Ibn Kathir.

- *Jami’ al-Bayan* by Abu Ja’far al-Tabari

All knowledge of tafsir has its foundation in the tafsir of al-Tabari. It shows one how to reconcile variant opinions of the mufassirin, compare with other ayat, and deduce rulings, all in order to establish the correct meaning of the ayah. 

- *Al-Kashshaf* by al-Zamakhshari

The author of this tafsir, a notable Mu’tazili, set the foundation for all linguistic tafsir after him. It should be read with Futuh al-Ghuyub, al-Tibi’s highly regarded commentary. 

# Mastery (الإتقان)
- *Ruh al-Ma’ani* by Mahmud al-Alusi

This work is the culmination of Ottoman scholarship on balagha. His tafsir is primarily based on Irshad al-’Aql al-Salim by Abu al-Sa’ud, which was itself drawn from the commentaries of Al-Kashshaf by al-Zamkhshari and Anwar al-Tanzil by al-Baydawi. Al-Alusi builds on Abu al-Sa’ud’s work, making it the backbone of his tafsir and similar to what Abu al-Sa’ud did before him, he synthesizes all the commentaries on al-Zamakhshari and al-Baydawi written up until his time. 

- *Al-Tahrir wa’l-Tanwir* by Ibn ‘Ashur

This work is by far the greatest tafsir written in the modern period. Unlike many 20th century mufassirin, Ibn ‘Ashur was firmly grounded in the classical tradition, hailing from a scholarly aristocratic family of judges. The distinguishing feature of his work is his identification of ta’lil and underlining the maqasid of ayat. He also highlights rhetorical devices and reconciles different opinions. It was published between 1956 and 1970 and was the fruit of a lifetime of scholarship of the highest order.

He listed the following eight objectives for his tafsir:

- Reforming Islamic education
- Explaining correct beliefs
- Defining Quranic law
- Clarifying the policy of the Islamic community
- Analyzing the history of ancient punished community
- Demonstrating sound Quranic methods of proof and deduction
