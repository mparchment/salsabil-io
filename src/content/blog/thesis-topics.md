<u>Adillah Mukhtalaf Fiha:</u> Study the principles like istihsan, masalih mursalah, and sadd al-dhara'i, emphasizing their universality. Analyze the variance in application of these principles among the various madhabs. 

<u>Salman:</u> Would be interesting to look at most of the "mufradat" of the 4 madhabs. I reckon most of them probably come down to some difference in interpretation or qiyas rather than an actual usuli qaida.

<u>Elias:</u> I would suggest some students gather all of al-Tabari’s tarjihaat in one book.

<u>Amal Ahl al-Madinah:</u> Delve into the concept of Amal Ahl al-Madinah as understood and applied by Malik, al-Shafi'i, and other scholars of the Maliki madhab. Explore the role of amal in the Islamic legal tradition across madhabs.

<u>Istihsan and Masalih Mursalah:</u> Discuss the juristic tool of istihsan and its application in Islamic jurisprudence. Examine masalih mursalah and its impact on legal rulings and contrast its use across different madhahib.

<u>Mixing of Hujjah and Taqlid:</u> Investigate the intersection and confusion between hujjah and taqlid in Islamic legal theory. Study specific cases like qawl al-sahabi and mursal to illustrate these concepts.

<u>Hujjiyah and Application of Ijma’:</u> Explore the concept of Ijma, focusing on its hujjiyah and practical application in Islamic jurisprudence. Discuss the theoretical foundations, challenges, and implications of establishing ijma’.

<u>Ibn Qudamah's Qiyas:</u> Conduct a comparative analysis of Ibn Qudamah's theories of qiyas as presented in Rawdat al-Nadhir and their practical application in al-Mughni. Investigate the consistency in his jurisprudential approach between the two works.

<u>Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī’s Maslahah:</u> Focus on Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī's work on ethics, particularly his critique of the Ḥanafīs and Mu’tazilah in Dar al-Qawl. Study the evolution of al-Ṭūfī's thought, especially the transition to his later view that considerations of utility may override scriptural rulings, and the overall development of his ethical theory throughout his life.

<u>Mursal:</u> Discuss the evolution of how early scholars viewed the mursal hadith and its hujjiyah, especially investigating the impact al-Shafi’i had on the topic.

<u>Al-Tirmidhi’s Sunan:</u> Detailed study on Imam al-Tirmidhi and his Sunan focusing primarily on his usage of the term hasan and his broader usage of terminology. Compile the hadith in which Tirmidhi and other early scholars clarify the meaning of the hadith or explain why its literal interpretation is not taken. Along with this, collect and analyze the hadith for which practice of the Sahabah was firmly established in spite of the narration being deemed to be weak.

<u>Fiqh and Tafsir of Imam al-Ja’far:</u> I question the reliability of aqwal in fiqh and tafsir to Ja'far al-Sadiq. As far as I know, most of this is lost and the majority of what we have attributed to him is unreliable. It is a misnomer to call Shi’i Twelver law Ja’fari fiqh. Juday’ says here that much of his fiqh is spread throughout the books of Ahl al-Sunnah, but I imagine even then the riwayat vary in terms of reliability and that some are more stringent than others in verifying a qawl attributed to him.

<u>Political Economy of Early Modern England:</u> Study on the emergence of corporations and the Bubble Act which temporarily outlawed them. Focus on the distinction in responsibility between corporations and natural persons.

<u>Lived Law:</u> Documenting the way Islamic law was practiced throughout history, along with the disruptions imposed by the nation-state and modernity. Based on Leslie Pierce's Morality Tales.
